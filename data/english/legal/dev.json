With respect to ways of promoting the role of women in disarmament, nonproliferation and arms control, we suggest that (1) representatives of women's groups and associations be included in discussion panels and programmes on the topic; (2) advisory boards be established within national and international disarmament programmes, in coordination with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women); and (3) military observatories for gender equality be promoted as entities providing technical and administrative support for the inclusion of women in such programmes.
