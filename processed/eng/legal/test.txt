At OT O 
its OT O 
first OT O 
session OT O 
in LF B-LF 
1999 OT O 
, OT O 
the OT O 
Committee OT O 
recognized OT O 
that OT O 
the OT O 
EDI AN B-AN 
used OT O 
in LF I-LF 
earlier OT O 
reviews OT O 
had OT O 
reflected OT O 
some OT O 
elements OT O 
of OT O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
, OT O 
but OT O 
it LF I-LF 
felt OT O 
that OT O 
this OT O 
reflection OT O 
was OT O 
inadequate OT O 
to OT O 
cover OT O 
the OT O 
Committee OT O 
's OT O 
notion OT O 
of OT O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
as OT O 
`` OT O 
structural OT O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
'' OT O 
, OT O 
defined OT O 
as OT O 
the OT O 
risk OT O 
of OT O 
being OT O 
negatively OT O 
affected OT O 
by OT O 
unforeseen OT O 
events OT O 
beyond OT O 
the OT O 
control OT O 
of OT O 
a LF I-LF 
country OT O 
. OT O 
The OT O 
Committee OT O 
, OT O 
therefore OT O 
, OT O 
proposed OT O 
that OT O 
the OT O 
former OT O 
EDI AN I-AN 
be OT O 
replaced OT O 
by OT O 
an OT O
