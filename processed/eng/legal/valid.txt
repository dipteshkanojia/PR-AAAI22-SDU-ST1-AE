At OT B-O 
its OT B-O 
first OT B-O 
session OT B-O 
in LF B-LF 
1999 OT B-O 
, OT B-O 
the OT B-O 
Committee OT B-O 
recognized OT B-O 
that OT B-O 
the OT B-O 
EDI AN B-AN 
used OT B-O 
in LF I-LF 
earlier OT B-O 
reviews OT B-O 
had OT B-O 
reflected OT B-O 
some OT B-O 
elements OT B-O 
of OT B-O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
, OT B-O 
but OT B-O 
it LF I-LF 
felt OT B-O 
that OT B-O 
this OT B-O 
reflection OT B-O 
was OT B-O 
inadequate OT B-O 
to OT B-O 
cover OT B-O 
the OT B-O 
Committee OT B-O 
's OT B-O 
notion OT B-O 
of OT B-O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
as OT B-O 
`` OT B-O 
structural OT B-O 
vulnerability LF I-LF 
'' OT B-O 
, OT B-O 
defined OT B-O 
as OT B-O 
the OT B-O 
risk OT B-O 
of OT B-O 
being OT B-O 
negatively OT B-O 
affected OT B-O 
by OT B-O

events OT B-O 
beyond OT B-O 
the OT B-O

of OT B-O 
a LF I-LF 
country OT B-O 
. OT B-O 
The OT B-O 
Committee OT B-O 
, OT B-O 
therefore OT B-O 
, OT B-O 
proposed OT B-O 
that OT B-O 
the OT B-O
