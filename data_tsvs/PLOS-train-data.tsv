0	Thereafter, late endosome-based secretory pathways are thought to deliver Gag or assembled virions to the plasma membrane (PM) and extracellular milieu.	[[123, 125]]	[[106, 121]]	['PM']	['plasma membrane']	PMC1750931.nxml
1	Specifically, we demonstrate that HIV-1 Gag is delivered to the PM, and virions are efficiently released into the extracellular medium, when late endosome motility is abolished.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
2	Furthermore, we show that HIV-1 virions are efficiently released when assembly is rationally targeted to the PM, but not when targeted to late endosomes.	[[109, 111]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
3	Recently synthesized Gag first accumulates and assembles at the PM, but a proportion is subsequently internalized via endocytosis or phagocytosis, thus accounting for observations of endosomal localization.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
4	We conclude that HIV-1 assembly is initiated and completed at the PM, and not at endosomal membranes..	[[66, 68]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
5	Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Gag is the major virion structural protein, and Gag expression alone in a variety of human cell types is sufficient to generate extracellular virus-like particles (VLPs).	[[208, 211]]	[[186, 205]]	['VLP']	['virus-like particle']	PMC1750931.nxml
6	Gag exhibits several activities necessary for the formation of a complete particle [1], including an amino terminal myristoylated matrix (MA) domain that directs membrane binding, central capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid domains that drive multimerization and packaging of viral genomes, and a C-terminal domain (p6) that recruits class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) factors that are required for scission of the nascent virion bud [2,3]..	[[196, 198], [138, 140], [361, 364]]	[[188, 194], [130, 136], [335, 359]]	['CA', 'MA', 'VPS']	['capsid', 'matrix', 'vacuolar protein sorting']	PMC1750931.nxml
7	Historically, it was thought that almost all retrovirus Gag proteins were targeted selectively to the plasma membrane (PM) to induce efficient particle release.	[[119, 121]]	[[102, 117]]	['PM']	['plasma membrane']	PMC1750931.nxml
8	This view was based on electron microscopic or immunofluorescent detection of Gag proteins or budding structures at the PM of infected cells.	[[120, 122]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
9	Apparent HIV-1 assembly in endosomes appears especially prominent in macrophages, in which very large numbers of virion particles are found within compartments containing the late endosomal markers CD63 and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp1) [4–7].	[[247, 252]]	[[207, 245]]	['Lamp1']	['lysosome-associated membrane protein-1']	PMC1750931.nxml
10	These data suggested that Gag is initially targeted to late endosomal membranes and that Gag protein or assembled virions are subsequently delivered to the extracellular milieu or PM via an endosome-based secretory pathway.	[[180, 182]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
11	Elaborations of the endosome assembly model have suggested that HIV-1 assembly intermediates that are seen at the cell surface are only observed there because the PM contains late endosome-derived microdomains that arise following the fusion of late endosomes with the PM [10,18,19].	[[163, 165], [269, 271]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
12	Indeed, the Hrs protein, which targets endosomal membranes via a PI(3)P-binding Fab1/YOTB/Vac1/EEA1 (FYVE) domain to nucleate the recruitment of class E VPS factors, is functionally mimicked by HIV-1 Gag, in that both encode PTAP motifs that recruit endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I) to initiate budding events [21,22].	[[95, 99], [302, 307], [101, 105], [153, 156]]	[[250, 298]]	['EEA1', 'ESCRT', 'FYVE', 'VPS']	['endosomal sorting complex required for transport']	PMC1750931.nxml
13	Despite widespread acceptance of the notion that HIV-1 particles partially or completely assemble at endosomal membranes, this issue remains controversial because some studies have shown that HIV-1 virions can be endocytosed post-assembly if their release from the PM is inhibited in certain cell types [23,24] Moreover, other studies have suggested that PM localization may be achieved by Gag soon after its synthesis [25].	[[265, 267], [355, 357]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
14	Overall, these studies uniformly indicate that HIV-1 Gag specifically targets PM and not endosomal membranes and that targeting to the PM, but not to the endosomes, is essential for viral release in both an immortalized cell line and in primary macrophages.	[[78, 80], [135, 137]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
15	The endosomal localization of HIV-1 Gag and virions occurs as a result of internalization from the PM and is not a necessary intermediate for constitutive HIV-1 particle synthesis and release..	[[99, 101]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
16	We took a different approach, based on transient transfection and examination of the localization and release of very recently synthesized Gag-Pol or Gag–green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules.	[[181, 184]]	[[154, 179]]	['GFP']	['green fluorescent protein']	PMC1750931.nxml
17	Samples were collected every hour, as indicated, and cell and virion lysates were probed with anti–HIV-1 CA antibodies.	[[105, 107]]	[]	['CA']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml

19	(C) 293T cells expressing Gag-GFP (green) in the absence or presence of nocodazole were fixed 14-h post-transfection.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
20	(D) 293T cells expressing VSV-G in the absence or presence of nocodazole were fixed 14-h post-transfection.	[[26, 31]]	[]	['VSV-G']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
21	Samples were stained with anti–VSV-G antibodies (green) and with Hoechst 33258 (blue).	[[31, 36]]	[]	['VSV-G']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
22	If HIV-1 Gag is initially targeted to late endosomes to initiate assembly or transport to the PM, we reasoned that particle assembly and release should be dependent on endosome motility.	[[94, 96]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
23	Thus, nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization, which blocks endosome movement [26–29], should perturb HIV-1 Gag movement to the PM and particle release if endosomal membranes are the initial sites to which Gag is targeted.	[[136, 138]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
24	Microscopic examination of Gag-GFP in 293T cells at 14-h post-transfection revealed a diffuse cytoplasmic signal and intense accumulations at the PM (Figure 1C).	[[31, 34], [146, 148]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
25	This predominantly PM localization was unchanged in cells treated with nocodazole during the entire period of Gag-GFP synthesis (Figure 1C).	[[114, 117], [19, 21]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
26	In contrast, when nocodazole was applied during vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) synthesis, the protein failed to be transported to the PM (Figure 1D).	[[151, 153], [89, 94]]	[[48, 87]]	['PM', 'VSV-G']	['vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein']	PMC1750931.nxml
27	As described previously [30], VSV-G localized in a perinuclear area and at the PM in control cells, whereas in nocodazole-treated cells, the protein was found in vesicles that were dispersed throughout the cell (Figure 1D), indicating that the microtubule-dependent secretory pathway was effectively blocked in these experiments.	[[79, 81], [30, 35]]	[]	['PM', 'VSV-G']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
28	Thus, the microtubule network, and by inference the active transport of endosomes within 293T cells, appeared not to be required for HIV-1 Gag transport to the PM or particle assembly..	[[160, 162]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
29	Immunofluorescence examination of the endogenous late endosome marker Lamp1 in 293T cells revealed a characteristic collapse of dispersed Lamp1+ compartments to a perinuclear region of the cells within 2 to 4 h of U18666A treatment (Figure 2A).	[[70, 75]]	[]	['Lamp1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
30	In contrast, the distribution of endogenous early endosomal antigen (EEA1) was unaffected (Figure 2A), demonstrating that U1866A interferes specifically with the localization of later endosomes.	[[69, 73]]	[]	['EEA1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
31	Additionally, dynamic observation of endosomes marked with a 2xHrsFYVE-GFP protein in live cells revealed that their movement was abolished following application of U18666A (Videos S1 and S2).	[[71, 74]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
32	Importantly, when U18666A was added to HIV-1 Gag-GFP–transfected cells during the entire 14-h time course of its synthesis, the ability of Gag-GFP to target the PM was unaffected (Figure 2B).	[[143, 146], [161, 163]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
33	Thus, both microtubules and the movement of late endosomes within 293T cells appear entirely dispensable for HIV-1 Gag targeting to the PM and particle egress..	[[136, 138]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
34	Cells treated with U18666A or DMSO for 14 h were fixed and stained with anti-Lamp1 or anti-EEA1 antibodies (red) and Hoechst 33258 (blue).	[[91, 95], [77, 82]]	[]	['EEA1', 'Lamp1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
35	(B) 293T cells expressing Gag-GFP (green) in the presence or absence of U18666A, which was added immediately after transfection.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
36	Numerical values below the blots indicate VLP p24CA signal intensities, derived by densitometry; absence of a value indicates undetectable signal..	[[42, 45]]	[]	['VLP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
37	We found three general patterns of Gag-GFP localization in transiently transfected 293T cells: in some cells, a diffuse cytoplasmic signal alone, that likely corresponds to non-membrane bound Gag-GFP [33], was observed, whereas in other cells, it was accompanied by PM accumulation or by accumulation at both internal compartments and at the PM (Figure 3A).	[[39, 42], [196, 199], [266, 268], [342, 344]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
38	Importantly, the apparent distribution of Gag-GFP in 293T cells was strongly dependent on the time after transfection at which they were fixed for imaging.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
39	Indeed, a temporal analysis revealed that cells exhibiting PM Gag-GFP accumulation were evident very early after transfection (4 h) and began to predominate between 8 and 10 h after transfection (Figure 3B).	[[66, 69], [59, 61]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
40	Conversely, cells exhibiting Gag-GFP accumulation at both the PM and internal sites became evident only later, and were always fewer than those in which only PM accumulation could be seen, maximally representing 30% at 24-h and 48-h post-transfection (Figure 3B)..

48	293T cells expressing Gag-GFP together with the indicated proteins were fixed at 24-h post-transfection and the proportion of cells (out of 100 counted) in which Gag was found at the PM, or both at internal accumulations and at the PM was determined..	[[26, 29], [183, 185], [232, 234]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
49	Samples were collected at 24-h post-transfection as indicated, and cell and virion lysates were probed with anti-HIV-1 CA antibodies.	[[119, 121]]	[]	['CA']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
50	Numerical values below the blots indicate VLP p24CA signal intensities, derived by densitometry..	[[42, 45]]	[]	['VLP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
51	As expected from previous studies [4,10–12,32], a significant portion of intracellular Gag-GFP that was observed at late time points was associated with compartments that contained endogenous CD63 or Lamp1 (Figure 3C), both of which mark late endosomes [34,35].	[[91, 94], [200, 205]]	[]	['GFP', 'Lamp1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
52	However, some intracellular Gag-GFP concentrations were associated with endogenous EEA1+ compartments, or with co-expressed Rab5a-CherryFP (Figure 3C), both of which mark early endosomes [36,37].	[[32, 35]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
53	Indeed this appeared to be the case, because endosomal accumulation of Gag-GFP at late time points was inhibited when Gag-GFP was co-expressed with dominant negative forms of EPS-15, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis [38], or with a mutant version of Rab5a (S34N), which blocks endocytic vesicle fusion (Figure 3D) [39].	[[75, 78], [122, 125]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
54	The globular head of HIV-1 MA is responsible for membrane binding and contains the targeting information that governs the location of HIV-1 particle assembly [40,41].	[[27, 29]]	[]	['MA']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
55	Although such manipulations can, in some cases, relax the membrane-targeting specificity of HIV-1 Gag, some MA-deleted HIV-1 Gag proteins can generate infectious extracellular particles.	[[108, 110]]	[]	['MA']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
56	If HIV-1 Gag is initially targeted to endosomal membranes, we reasoned that replacement of the MA globular head with alternative membrane binding domains that target endosomes should result in Gag proteins whose localization mimics the wild-type protein.	[[95, 97]]	[]	['MA']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
57	Hrs is particularly noteworthy in this context since, like HIV-1 Gag, it binds Tsg101 (ESCRT-I) and initiates class E VPS factor recruitment, leading to intra-lumenal vesicle generation [21,22].	[[87, 92], [118, 121]]	[]	['ESCRT', 'VPS']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
58	Thus, a Gag protein that has the targeting properties of Hrs-FYVE should accurately target the membranes to which ESCRT-I is normally recruited and therefore mimic authentic HIV-1 assembly and release into the lumen of endosomes, if that is what normally occurs.	[[114, 119], [61, 65]]	[]	['ESCRT', 'FYVE']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
59	Additionally, the Phox homology (PX) domain of the p40phox subunit of NADPH oxidase also binds specifically and with high affinity to PI(3)P and localizes to endosomes [48,49].	[[33, 35]]	[]	['PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
60	Thus, both the Hrs FYVE domain and the p40phox PX domain were appended to HIV-1 Gag in place of the MA globular head, generating FYVE-Gag and PX-Gag, respectively (Figure 4A).	[[19, 23], [129, 133], [100, 102], [47, 49], [142, 144]]	[]	['FYVE', 'FYVE', 'MA', 'PX', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
61	Alternatively, protein kinase C conserved domain 2 (C2) domains are approximately 120-residue modules, found in a variety of proteins, that constitutively associate with a variety of membranes [50].	[[52, 54]]	[]	['C2']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
62	Although its precise lipid binding specificity is not known, we have previously shown that the C2 domain of the HECT ubiquitin ligase, WWP1, can direct a heterologous protein to the PM [51]..	[[95, 97], [182, 184]]	[]	['C2', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
63	Cells expressing FYVE-Gag-GFP, PX-Gag-GFP, or C2-Gag-GFP (green) were fixed at 24-h post-transfection.	[[46, 48], [17, 21], [26, 29], [38, 41], [53, 56], [31, 33]]	[]	['C2', 'FYVE', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
64	(C) FYVE-Gag-GFP targets late endosomes.	[[4, 8], [13, 16]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
65	293T cells expressing FYVE-Gag-GFP (green) were fixed at 24-h post-transfection and stained with anti–Lamp-1 or anti-CD63 antibodies (red).	[[22, 26], [31, 34]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
66	Insets show expanded views of individual FYVE-Gag-GFP accumulations.	[[41, 45], [50, 53]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
67	Thus, when the MA globular head was replaced by the WWP1 C2 domain (Figure 4A), C2-Gag-GFP accumulated almost exclusively at the PM of 293T cells (Figure 4B).	[[57, 59], [80, 82], [87, 90], [15, 17], [129, 131]]	[]	['C2', 'C2', 'GFP', 'MA', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
68	Conversely, both FYVE-Gag-GFP and PX-Gag-GFP were exclusively targeted to intracellular vesicular structures in 293T cells, and no PM localization was observed (Figure 4B).	[[17, 21], [26, 29], [41, 44], [131, 133], [34, 36]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'PM', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
69	Analysis of FYVE-Gag-GFP distribution revealed extensive co-localization with endogenous CD63 and Lamp1 (Figure 4C).	[[12, 16], [21, 24], [98, 103]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP', 'Lamp1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
70	When FYVE-Gag-GFP was co-expressed with mRed-Hrs, both proteins targeted the same vesicles (Figure 4C), confirming that FYVE-Gag authentically targeted endosomal membranes.	[[5, 9], [120, 124], [14, 17]]	[]	['FYVE', 'FYVE', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
71	Live cell microscopy revealed that FYVE-Gag-GFP–containing endosomes were motile and moved rapidly in curvilinear paths within the cell interior.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['FYVE']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
72	Moreover, when the formation of swollen endosomes was induced by over-expression of a “dominant active” Rab5a (Q79L) mutant [39], numerous fluorescent FYVE-Gag particles were observed inside the lumen of the Rab5a-bound structures (Figure 4C), suggesting that particles were able to bud into the lumen of endosomes.	[[151, 155]]	[]	['FYVE']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
73	Importantly, these same endosomal markers (CD63, Lamp1, and Rab5a) have previously been reported to co-localize with wild-type HIV-1 Gag [4,10–12,23,32].	[[49, 54]]	[]	['Lamp1']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
74	Similar endosomal localization patterns were observed with PX-Gag-GFP (Figure S1).	[[66, 69], [59, 61]]	[]	['GFP', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
75	Authentic intracellular assembly by FYVE-Gag-Pol was confirmed by electron microscopic examination of 293T cells co-expressing the Rab5a (Q79L) and FYVE-Gag-Pol.	[[36, 40], [148, 152]]	[]	['FYVE', 'FYVE']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
76	Notably, however, unlike wild-type HIV-1 Gag-Pol, FYVE-Gag-Pol budding structures were not found at the PM..	[[50, 54], [104, 106]]	[]	['FYVE', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml

82	Assembly assays in 293T cells revealed that Gag proteins that were rationally targeted to the PM, namely C2-Gag-GFP and C2-Gag-Pol, generated extracellular particles as efficiently as wild-type Gag-GFP and Gag-Pol (Figure 5B).	[[105, 107], [120, 122], [112, 115], [198, 201], [94, 96]]	[]	['C2', 'C2', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
83	Moreover, C2-Gag-Pol VLPs were accurately processed (Figure 5B) and contained predominantly mature, fully processed CA protein.	[[10, 12], [116, 118], [21, 24]]	[]	['C2', 'CA', 'VLP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
84	Remarkably, when a packageable GFP-expressing HIV-1 vector genome and a VSV-G envelope protein were provided in trans, C2-Gag-Pol proved capable of generating virion particles that were almost as infectious as those generated by wild-type HIV-1 Gag-Pol (Figure 5C).	[[119, 121], [31, 34], [72, 77]]	[]	['C2', 'GFP', 'VSV-G']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
85	Therefore, direct targeting of the PM by HIV-1 Gag is fully compatible with the generation of mature, infectious HIV-1 particles, and the MA globular head can be functionally replaced by a heterologous non-myristoylated membrane binding domain, provided that it targets an appropriate cell membrane..	[[138, 140], [35, 37]]	[]	['MA', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
86	In marked contrast, little or no extracellular virion release was observed from cells expressing FYVE-Gag or PX-Gag, in the context of Gag-GFP or Gag-Pol proteins (Figure 5B), even though the expected pattern of Gag processing was observed (Figure 5B).	[[97, 101], [139, 142], [109, 111]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
87	Occasionally, CA was barely detectable in the extracellular medium of FYVE-Gag-Pol expressing cells, and low levels of infectious particles could be detected, but this was less than 1% of that observed with wild type or C2-Gag-Pol (Figure 5C).

100	As was the case in 293T cells, three readily distinguishable patterns of Gag-GFP localization (diffuse only, diffuse accompanied by PM accumulations, and diffuse accompanied by both PM and intracellular accumulations) were evident in macrophages (Figure 6A).	[[77, 80], [132, 134], [182, 184]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
101	Strikingly, at 4- to 6-h post-transfection, Gag-GFP localization was either entirely diffuse or accompanied by accumulations only at the PM (Figure 6A and 6C).	[[48, 51], [137, 139]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
102	A clear PM accumulation of Gag-GFP was observed when its distribution was analyzed with deconvolved optical sections acquired approximately at center of the cell's vertical dimension, and at the cell–coverslip interface (Figure 6A).	[[31, 34], [8, 10]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
103	Temporal analysis revealed that the population of cells containing only diffuse Gag-GFP was progressively replaced by cells in which Gag-GFP was also located at the PM (Figure 6C).	[[84, 87], [137, 140], [165, 167]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
104	However, Gag was also detected at the PM in these cells.	[[38, 40]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
105	Co-localization studies, done at 24-h post-transfection, revealed that internal Gag-GFP particles associated with large vesicular structures positive for mRed-Hrs (Figure 6D), which is found on both late endosomes and phagosomes in macrophages [52].	[[84, 87]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
106	As was the case in 293T cells, some Gag-GFP was also found in association with early endosomes containing endogenous EEA1 (Figure 6D)..	[[117, 121], [40, 43]]	[]	['EEA1', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
107	We first verified that nocodazole caused dissolution of the microtubule network in macrophages and that U18666A caused endosomes marked by 2XFYVE-Hrs-GFP, but not EEA1+ early endosomes, to collapse into a perinuclear cluster (Figure S2).

108	In macrophages expressing Gag-GFP that were incubated in medium containing nocodazole or U18666A for the entire duration of Gag-GFP synthesis (up to 24 h), Gag-GFP localized primarily to the PM, both in untreated cells or in cells treated with nocodazole or U18666A (Figure 7A).

109	Moreover, a temporal analysis of Gag-GFP particle generation revealed that these treatments had little or no effect on the kinetics or efficiency of particle release (Figure 7B).	[[37, 40]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml

114	Using precisely the same Gag-GFP constructs as previously (Figure 4A), C2-Gag-GFP, like wild-type Gag-GFP, targeted the macrophage PM, whereas FYVE-Gag-GFP and PX-Gag-GFP localized in intracellular compartments (Figure 8A).	[[71, 73], [143, 147], [29, 32], [78, 81], [102, 105], [152, 155], [167, 170], [131, 133], [160, 162]]	[]	['C2', 'FYVE', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'PM', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
115	Co-localization studies showed that FYVE- and PX-Gag-GFP targeted CD63+ and Lamp1+ endosomes (Figure 8B).	[[36, 40], [53, 56], [46, 48]]	[]	['FYVE', 'GFP', 'PX']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
116	Importantly, Gag-GFP proteins that were targeted to macrophage CD63+ endosomes failed to generate extracellular particles, whereas C2-Gag-GFP that targeted the PM efficiently generated extracellular particles (Figure 8C).

134	Some Gag puncta were also detected at the PM in about 60% of cells and were usually accompanied by intracellular accumulation (Figure 10B).	[[42, 44]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
135	Moreover, massive accumulation of Gag puncta, presumably representing viral particles, was seen at the PM of virtually all cytochalasin D–treated infected macrophages.	[[103, 105]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml

138	Numerical values below the blots indicate p24CA signal intensities in cells and VLPs, derived by densitometry..	[[80, 83]]	[]	['VLP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
139	The rareness with which we observed Gag puncta at the PM of HIV-1–infected but otherwise untreated macrophages prompted us to examine Gag localization using an antibody-independent technique that enables visualization of both unprocessed and processed Gag proteins with equal efficiency.	[[54, 56]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
140	When pseudotyped with VSV-G, NL4–3 (MA/YFP) produced only approximately 2-fold fewer infectious particles as compared to unmodified HIV-1 (unpublished data).	[[22, 27]]	[]	['VSV-G']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
141	However, in addition to diffuse fluorescence and intracellular Gag(MA/YFP) accumulations, we also observed significant accumulation of Gag(MA/YFP) at the macrophage PM, and evident Gag puncta at the PM and cell–coverslip interface in many cells (Figure 10C).	[[165, 167], [199, 201]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
142	As previously, there was massive accumulation of particles at the PM of infected cells upon treatment with cytochalasin D during the final 24 h of the assay (Figure 10C).	[[66, 68]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
143	Thus, the prominent intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 Gag that is observed in macrophages clearly occurs via an actin-dependent process, most likely internalization from the PM..	[[176, 178]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
144	Thus, accumulation of particles at the PM in actin-disrupted cells was not a result of retention of virions that otherwise would be released.	[[39, 41]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
145	First, Gag localization early after expression is observed only at the PM, suggesting it is the initial membrane targeted by Gag.	[[71, 73]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
146	Second, arresting late endosome movement within cells using two pharmacological inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action had no effect on accumulation of Gag-GFP at the PM, or on extracellular particle release.	[[163, 166], [174, 176]]	[]	['GFP', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
147	Third, rational targeting of HIV-1 Gag using a membrane binding domain that targets endosomes failed to deliver Gag or particles to the PM or extracellular milieu.	[[136, 138]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
148	Indeed, we used a membrane-targeting domain that is ordinarily responsible for nucleating ESCRT protein recruitment to endosomes.	[[90, 95]]	[]	['ESCRT']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
149	Conversely a Gag protein that was rationally targeted to the PM closely mimicked the localization of wild-type Gag and allowed efficient release of infectious particles.	[[61, 63]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
150	The findings documented herein are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that HIV-1 Gag ordinarily targets the endosomal or endosome-like membrane domains normally targeted by ESCRT proteins, and thereby follows an active exosome-like release pathway.	[[181, 186]]	[]	['ESCRT']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
151	Rather, these data suggest that the intrinsic PM-selective binding of the MA Gag domain determines the site at which HIV-1 assembly is initiated.	[[74, 76], [46, 48]]	[]	['MA', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
152	Indeed, recent evidence suggests that the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag binds specifically to PM-resident phospholipids, in particular PI(4,5)P2 [55,56].	[[42, 44], [87, 89]]	[]	['MA', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
153	Moreover, ESCRT proteins can be recruited from a cytoplasmic pool to membranes where they are not ordinarily located [57], and it is therefore not necessary to invoke endosomal membranes as intermediates to explain HIV-1 release..	[[10, 15]]	[]	['ESCRT']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
154	Although these studies provide several lines of evidence that HIV-1 assembly occurs primarily at the PM, it is nevertheless true that numerous previous studies, as well as our own observations, have demonstrated that accumulated HIV-1 particles can be observed within endosomes of many cells at steady state (see Introduction).	[[101, 103]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
155	How can this be explained in terms of a model in which particle assembly occurs at the PM? In fact, these previous studies can readily be reconciled with the findings described herein if one invokes internalization of nascent or completely assembled virions from the PM.	[[87, 89]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
156	Internalization of PM occurs in essentially all cell types via endocytic or phagocytic mechanisms, but the predominant mechanism and the rate of PM turnover likely varies with cell type.	[[19, 21], [145, 147]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
157	Inevitably, the overall steady-state cellular localization of HIV-1 Gag and virion particles is governed by several kinetic factors, including the rate at which Gag moves to the PM following its synthesis.	[[178, 180]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
158	Once Gag and/or virions are at the PM, the rates at which they are either released as extracellular virions or internalized are also crucial kinetic factors determining steady-state cellular distribution.	[[35, 37]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
159	In principle, therefore, a slow rate of synthesis—which would result in a slow rate of PM binding and assembly—coupled with a high rate of PM internalization would, over time, result in a steady-state distribution in which most HIV-1 Gag or virions accumulate in endosomal compartments.	[[87, 89], [139, 141]]	[]	['PM', 'PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
160	Consistent with this idea, inhibition of actin polymerization, which reduces the rate of phagocytosis, resulted in very dramatic accumulation of HIV-1 particles at the PM instead of in endosomes in infected primary macrophages.	[[168, 170]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
161	In a similar way, this study shows that blockade of endocytosis in 293T cells clearly reduced the already quite small fraction of cells in which intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 Gag-GFP is evident..	[[185, 188]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
162	Overall, it seems likely that the intracellular HIV-1 particles that are observed in a variety of cell types can be accounted for, perhaps in all cases, by internalization from the PM by endocytic or phagocytic mechanisms.	[[181, 183]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
163	It is possible that HIV-1 particles whose assembly was initiated at the PM but were then internalized could retain infectivity for some time and eventually find their way to the extracellular milieu.	[[72, 74]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
164	The subsequent fate of the nascent particle appears to be governed by whether that PM domain remains at the surface, enabling particle release, or internalized, resulting in particle retention in endosomes..	[[83, 85]]	[]	['PM']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml
165	Plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag-Pol and Gag-GFP proteins, namely pCR3.1/SYNGP and pCR3.1/Gag-GFP, were previously described [33] and were used to generate plasmids expressing retargeted Gag proteins.	[[42, 45], [91, 94]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1750931.nxml

184	Among these elements are enhancers, which establish gene expression states, and Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs), which take over from enhancers and maintain transcription states of several hundred developmentally important genes.	[[118, 121]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
185	We used a combination of genome-wide bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation at specific loci, to evaluate PRE evolution across four Drosophila species. Our results show that PRE evolution is extraordinarily dynamic.	[[120, 123], [188, 191]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
186	First, we show that the numbers of PREs differ dramatically between species.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
187	Second, we demonstrate that functional binding sites within PREs at conserved positions turn over rapidly in evolution, as has been observed for enhancer elements. Finally, although it is theoretically possible that new elements can arise out of nonfunctional sequence, evidence that they do so is lacking.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
188	We show here that functional PREs are found at nonorthologous sites in conserved gene loci. By demonstrating that PRE evolution is not limited to the adaptation of preexisting elements, these findings document a novel dimension of cis-regulatory evolution..	[[29, 32], [114, 117]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
189	We focus on Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs), which regulate several hundred developmental genes, and are vital for maintaining cell identities.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
190	We find that PRE evolution is extraordinarily dynamic: not only motif composition, but also the total number of PREs, and even their genomic positions, have changed dramatically in evolution.	[[13, 16], [112, 115]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
191	By demonstrating that the evolution of PREs goes far beyond the gradual adaptation of preexisting elements, this study documents a novel dimension of regulatory evolution.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
192	We propose that PRE evolution provides a rich source of potential diversity between species..	[[16, 19]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
193	Another important class is Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs), first identified in the Drosophila homeotic (hox) gene complexes [3,4], where they maintain the transcriptional states of hox genes that have been determined earlier on in development by embryonic enhancers [5–7].	[[117, 120], [194, 197], [65, 68]]	[[107, 115]]	['hox', 'hox', 'PRE']	['homeotic']	PMC2573935.nxml
194	The hox PREs preserve the transcription patterns of their associated genes stably over many cell generations, long after the proteins that bind the enhancers have disappeared.	[[4, 7], [8, 11]]	[]	['hox', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
195	Thus, hox PREs are epigenetic memory elements [8].	[[6, 9], [10, 13]]	[]	['hox', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
196	Although PREs are similar to enhancers in many ways, the most important functional difference between these two types of elements is that enhancers respond to local differences in concentration of the transcription factors that bind them, whereas the Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are ubiquitously expressed; thus, the PRE element responds to the transcriptional state of the promoter [3,4]. Since their initial discovery in the hox complexes, it has become clear that PREs regulate several hundred other genes in addition.	[[456, 459], [267, 270], [9, 12], [346, 349], [496, 499], [293, 297]]	[]	['hox', 'PcG', 'PRE', 'PRE', 'PRE', 'TrxG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
197	Consistent with the nature of these target genes, the PcG proteins are essential to the correct identities of both stem cells and differentiated cells [16,17]..	[[54, 57]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
198	melanogaster, many PRE elements that have similar functional properties in transgenic assays are enriched in preferred pairs of motifs, enabling the identification of a subset of Drosophila PREs by computational prediction [18,19].	[[19, 22], [190, 193]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
199	However, these same elements show no preferred order or number of motif pairs, suggesting that the design of PREs in terms of linear arrangement of motifs is flexible [18].	[[109, 112]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
200	Furthermore, fly PREs can act many tens of kilobases upstream, downstream, or in the introns of the genes they regulate [9,10], suggesting that their position relative to their cognate promoter is also flexible.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
201	This diversity of design among D. melanogaster PREs raises the question of whether these differences are important for function, and whether PRE position at each gene is conserved across different Drosophila species.	[[47, 50], [141, 144]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
202	The bithoraxoid (bxd) PRE, which regulates the hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx; FBgn0003944), shows large blocks of conserved sequence across several Drosophila species, supporting the idea that PRE position is evolutionarily constrained [7,20].	[[47, 50], [22, 25], [191, 194]]	[]	['hox', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
203	However, the conservation of the several hundred other PREs in the D. melanogaster genome has not been evaluated, and it is not known whether these PREs are also evolutionarily constrained..	[[55, 58], [148, 151]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
204	Consistent with this prediction, a recent genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip (ChIP-chip) study in D.	[[93, 97]]	[[54, 83]]	['ChIP']	['chromatin immunoprecipitation']	PMC2573935.nxml
205	In this paper, we use a combination of alignment-independent prediction of cis-regulatory elements [18,19], comparative genomics, and experimental validation to examine cis-regulatory evolution beyond motif turnover for PREs in four Drosophila species.	[[220, 223]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
206	This analysis shows that PRE evolution is extraordinarily dynamic.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
207	We show both computationally and experimentally that the numbers of PRE elements, their motif composition, and their genomic position change rapidly in evolution.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
208	We identify at least two classes of PREs: those whose positions are constrained in evolution (such as the hox PREs), and those that do not have constrained positions.	[[106, 109], [36, 39], [110, 113]]	[]	['hox', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
209	Remarkably, despite the general conservation of the hox PREs, we identify an extra functional PRE in the Bithorax complex of D.	[[52, 55], [56, 59], [94, 97]]	[]	['hox', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
210	By demonstrating that PRE evolution is not limited to the adaptation of preexisting elements, these findings document a novel dimension of cis-regulatory evolution. The implications of these findings for evolutionary diversity are discussed..	[[22, 25]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
211	We have previously developed an algorithm that predicts PREs in the genome of D.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
212	In [18], 43 predicted PREs were selected for experimental analysis; 29 of these were enriched for PcG proteins in ChIP experiments in S2 cells.	[[114, 118], [98, 101], [22, 25]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
213	A further 12 of those 14 sites that were not enriched in [18] were found to be strongly enriched for PcG proteins in other cell types, or were confirmed in transgenic assays [10,11,18].	[[101, 104]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
214	Thus, over 95% of these 43 predictions were functional in one cell type or another, confirming the predictive power of the algorithm for correctly identifying PRE elements..	[[159, 162]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
215	Comparison of the full set of 167 predictions [18] with genome-wide binding profiles of PcG proteins performed in different cell types or in embryos [9–11] revealed a partial overlap.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
216	Using the most statistically stringent score cutoff (a score of 157, corresponding to an E-value, or expected number of false positives, of 1.0), PREs were correctly predicted at 20% (37 of 186) of experimentally defined binding sites in Sg4 cells [10].	[[146, 149]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
217	Lower score cutoffs gave higher coverage of ChIP sites [8]; however, it is not clear how many of the detected PcG binding sites in [10] contain functional PREs.	[[44, 48], [110, 113], [155, 158]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
218	Indeed, a recent ChIP-chip analysis of transcriptional regulators in Drosophila embryos demonstrated that many detected binding sites appear not to be functional [2]. In addition, we predict many PREs at sites at which no ChIP enrichment was observed [10].	[[17, 21], [222, 226], [196, 199]]	[]	['ChIP', 'ChIP', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
219	These include, for example, the well-characterised Fab-7 PRE [43].	[[57, 60]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
220	For a selection of these predicted sites, ChIP in other cell types (9/12 positive) and transgene analysis (3/3 positive) have confirmed that they are indeed bona fide PRE elements and not false-positive predictions [9,18]..	[[42, 46], [167, 170]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
221	The fact that these predicted and verified PREs were not all enriched in any one cell type is consistent with the partial overlap observed between three recent genome-wide Polycomb binding profiles (28% to 34%) generated by ChIP or DNA adenine methyltransferase mapping (DamID) on different D.	[[224, 228], [43, 46]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
222	Other studies have also observed discrepancies between genome-wide ChIP data and conserved cis-regulatory elements identified by comparative genomics [2,36].	[[67, 71]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
223	Together, these comparisons show that neither ChIP nor computational analysis provides a comprehensive list of all cis-regulatory elements in the genome: computational analysis can identify sites of potential function, whereas ChIP gives a measure of cell-type– or developmental-stage–specific deployment of these elements.	[[46, 50], [227, 231]]	[]	['ChIP', 'ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
224	For this reason, in the present study, we combine computational prediction of PRE elements with ChIP and transgenic analysis of specific loci..	[[96, 100], [78, 81]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
225	To assess the evolutionary behaviour of PREs independent of genome alignment, we applied the algorithm to four Drosophila genomes: D.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
226	melanogaster PRE sequences.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
227	Its performance on other Drosophila genomes was confirmed by comparison of PRE predictions in the homeotic Bithorax complexes of all four species, showing that well-characterised PREs in D.	[[75, 78], [179, 182]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
228	melanogaster PcG proteins were confirmed in the other three species by western blot (Figure 2F) and were used for ChIP.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
229	This analysis showed that PcG proteins were enriched on the predicted PREs of the Bithorax complex in embryos of all four species (Figures 1B and S1, and unpublished data).	[[26, 29], [70, 73]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
230	Interestingly, Polycomb protein (PC) and Polyhomeotic protein (PH) were detected at similar levels on the bxd PRE in D. melanogaster, but at different levels on the bxd PRE in the other species (Figure 1B).	[[33, 35], [63, 65], [110, 113], [169, 172]]	[]	['PC', 'PH', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
231	Similar behaviour was also detected in other ChIP experiments (Figures 3C, 4B, and 4D).	[[45, 49]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
232	It is unlikely that these differences arise from different antibody affinities in the different species, because both the PC and PH antibodies gave essentially identical results in western blots on embryonic extracts of the four species (Figure 2F).	[[122, 124], [129, 131]]	[]	['PC', 'PH']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
233	Furthermore, the differences in ChIP enrichments are not consistently higher for a given antibody or species (see, for example, Figure 4B and 4D).	[[32, 36]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
234	We reason that these differences may arise from the fact that we used embryos for the ChIP experiments.	[[86, 90]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
235	The ChIP results represent an average of binding levels for a mixture of cell types, and a range of embryonic stages from 0–16 h.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
236	We observed that embryonic development in the four species proceeds at slightly different rates, which would affect the distribution of embryonic stages in a 0–16-h collection, and may therefore affect the observed binding levels of PC and PH.	[[233, 235]]	[]	['PC']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
237	Alternatively, the different binding of PC and PH may reflect different species-specific compositions of PcG complexes at different PREs..	[[40, 42], [105, 108], [47, 49], [132, 135]]	[]	['PC', 'PcG', 'PH', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml

249	Around this orthologous region, PREs are predicted in sequence areas of increasing sizes (1 kb, 10 kb, 20 kb, and chromosome-wide) and with increasing score cutoffs (70, 104, 114, and 157).	[[32, 35]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml

286	To evaluate interspecies differences in PRE number by independent experimental means, we examined the distribution of PC by immunofluorescence on polytene chromosomes prepared from third instar larvae of the four species.	[[118, 120], [40, 43]]	[]	['PC', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
287	This analysis detected over twice as many PC bands in D. pseudoobscura as in the other three species, consistent with the prediction of over twice as many PREs (Figure 2C and 2E).	[[42, 44], [155, 158]]	[]	['PC', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
288	Essentially identical results were obtained for PH (unpublished data).	[[48, 50]]	[]	['PH']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
289	The anti-PC and -PH antibodies were raised against the D. melanogaster proteins, but detected the PC and PH proteins equally efficiently in a western blot of all three other species (Figure 2F).	[[9, 11], [98, 100], [17, 19], [105, 107]]	[]	['PC', 'PC', 'PH', 'PH']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
290	Nevertheless, to confirm that differences in band number do not reflect differences in antibody behaviour, polytene stainings were also performed with antibodies against histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3; Figure 2D and 2E).	[[209, 217]]	[]	['H3K27me3']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
291	This epitope is identical in all four species and is a hallmark of PcG action that is conserved from flies to vertebrates [8].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
292	The band numbers, calculated from analysis of multiple chromosome spreads, were similar for PC and H3K27me3 in all four species, and were consistently approximately twice as high in D.	[[99, 107], [92, 94]]	[]	['H3K27me3', 'PC']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
293	This analysis confirms that in salivary glands, D. pseudoobscura has at least twice as many binding sites for PC protein as any other species, and is consistent with the results of the prediction.	[[110, 112]]	[]	['PC']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
294	To ascertain how many genes with predicted PREs D.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
295	pseudoobscura have in common, we compared genes that were in the neighbourhood of the PRE, not farther than 10 kb from its closest end.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
296	Including PREs predicted with a fixed genome-wide cutoff and PREs predicted with our dynamic scoring scheme, we thus determined 166 genes unique to D. melanogaster, 349 genes unique to D.	[[10, 13], [61, 64]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
297	This indicates that not only the numbers of PREs differ between D. pseudoobscura and the melanogaster subgroup, but also the identities of the genes they regulate..	[[44, 47]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
298	Despite these differences in PRE number, we expected that a large proportion of PREs would have conserved genomic position.	[[29, 32], [80, 83]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
299	To ascertain whether this is indeed the case, we compared each predicted PRE in a given genome to its nearest counterpart, identified by dynamic scoring in a second genome.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
300	For each PRE hit in the first genome, a BLAST search was performed on the second genome, and the distance between the BLAST hit and the nearest statistically significant PRE was calculated (Figure 2A). Figure 2G shows the distribution of these distances for D.	[[9, 12], [170, 173]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
301	Surprisingly, despite the statistical bonus given to PRE pairs with conserved position, this analysis predicts that many PREs do not have conserved position.	[[53, 56], [121, 124]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
302	yakuba comparison, although approximately 140 PRE pairs are within 1 kb of each other, we predict 30 pairs that are separated by over 10 kb.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
303	melanogaster–D. pseudoobscura comparison, PRE positions are less conserved still, with approximately 80 pairs within 1 kb, and approximately 80 that are over 10 kb apart in the two genomes.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
304	The PREs that have the highest conservation of position in all four genomes are listed in Table S1. In summary, these data predict that there are at least two classes of PRE elements: those whose positions are evolutionarily constrained, and those whose positions change rapidly in evolution..	[[4, 7], [170, 173]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
305	To test these predictions experimentally, we performed ChIP on embryos from all four species to evaluate binding of PcG proteins to predicted PRE sites in vivo. We focused on specific examples of two classes of predicted PRE: those that have conserved position, and those that do not.	[[55, 59], [116, 119], [142, 145], [221, 224]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PcG', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
306	For PREs with conserved position, we selected bxd and spalt major (salm; FBgn0004579) as examples of PREs that have been confirmed in D. melanogaster [4,10,47].	[[4, 7], [101, 104]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
307	ChIP analysis in embryos from all four species demonstrated robust PcG binding to these predicted PREs (bxd, Figure 1B; salm, Figure 3C), indicating that these sites do indeed have PRE function in all four species.	[[104, 108], [67, 70], [98, 101], [181, 184], [120, 125]]	[]	['bxd,', 'PcG', 'PRE', 'PRE', 'salm,']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
308	In the case of the salm PRE, the D.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
309	The bxd and salm PREs reside in orthologous regions in all four genomes, enabling us to ask whether the motifs that contribute to PRE function are located in the regions of highest conservation [20]. Unexpectedly, this was not the case (Figure 3A and 3D).	[[17, 20], [130, 133]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
310	The highest conserved regions (dark-grey boxes on D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura diagrams in Figure 3A and 3D) are typically devoid of PRE motifs.	[[141, 144]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
311	We examined other PREs that have conserved positions, and all showed a similar clustering of motifs in the less conserved regions (Figure S1, Table S1, and unpublished data).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
312	Where minimal functional PRE fragments have been defined [48–51], these do not map to the sites of highest conservation (Figures 3A and S1, and unpublished data). This raises the question of whether these highly conserved regions are important for other functions.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
313	Alternatively, they may contain unidentified motifs that are important for endogenous PRE function, but that are not required for minimal PRE function in reporter assays [7]..	[[86, 89], [138, 141]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
314	Furthermore, although each PRE has one or more clusters of motifs, the position and order of motifs within the cluster is not conserved.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
315	pseudoobscura comparison (red motifs, Figure 3A and 3D), but is also true to a lesser extent for pairs of PREs in more closely related species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba; Figure 3A and 3D).	[[106, 109]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
316	Other PREs that have conserved positions showed similar motif turnover (Figure S1, Table S1, and unpublished data).	[[6, 9]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
317	This rapid evolutionary turnover of motifs in PREs has been noted for the bxd PRE [7] and is similar to the turnover that has been observed in enhancer and promoter sequences [2,26,29,37,38], which suggests that motif turnover is a general feature of many classes of regulatory elements..	[[46, 49], [78, 81]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
318	We next selected examples of PREs that are predicted not to have conserved position, and used ChIP and transgenic assays to evaluate PRE function of the orthologous and nonorthologous sequences within selected loci.	[[94, 98], [29, 32], [133, 136]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
319	For this analysis, the trachealess (trh; FBgn0003749), decapentaplegic (dpp, FBgn0000490), and abdominal-A (abd-A; FBgn0000014) loci were selected (Figure 4).	[[72, 76]]	[]	['dpp,']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
320	At the trh locus, a PRE is predicted close to the promoter in the three most closely related species, D.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
321	This predicted PRE was also robustly bound by PcG proteins in embryos of these three species (Figure 4B, site 2). However, in D. pseudoobscura, although the trh coding region is well conserved, no PRE was predicted at the promoter (Figure 4A, bottom panel, site 2).	[[46, 49], [15, 18], [197, 200]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
322	Consistent with this prediction, ChIP analysis showed only moderate enrichment for PcG proteins at this site (Figure 4B, site 2).	[[33, 37], [83, 86]]	[]	['ChIP', 'PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
323	Instead, the strongest PRE prediction in the D. pseudoobscura trh locus is within the second intron (Figure 4A, site 1).	[[23, 26]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
324	Higher PcG enrichment at this intronic PRE than at the promoter site was detected in D. pseudoobscura, whereas this site was less enriched than the promoter site in the other three species (Figure 4B, site 1).	[[7, 10], [39, 42]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
325	This analysis suggests that whereas in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, the main site of PRE function is at the promoter, in D. pseudoobscura, PRE function is situated at the intron site some 5 kb away..	[[101, 104], [155, 158]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
326	For dpp, the situation is more complex: there are three predicted PRE sites, which have different scores in different species.	[[4, 8], [66, 69]]	[]	['dpp,', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
327	melanogaster and D. simulans, the predicted PRE score and the enrichment for PcG proteins at site 1 are higher than at sites 2 and 3 (Figure 4C and 4D, top two panels).	[[77, 80], [44, 47]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
328	yakuba, site 2 has the highest PRE score and showed the highest PcG enrichment.	[[64, 67], [31, 34]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
329	In D. pseudoobscura, the highest PRE prediction is at site 3 (the promoter site, Figure 4C). This site is bound by PcG proteins in D.	[[115, 118], [33, 36]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
330	Taken together, these results indicate that, like those of the trh locus, the dpp PREs are at different sites in different species, suggesting that gain or loss of PRE function at orthologous sites has occurred during evolution..	[[82, 85], [164, 167]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
331	In several cases, a PRE was predicted in one species, but had no detectable counterpart in other species.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
332	The Bithorax complex of D. melanogaster contains the best-characterised PREs, which act to maintain expression domains of the three hox genes Abdominal-B (Abd-B; FBgn0000015), abd-A, and Ubx.	[[176, 182], [155, 160], [132, 135], [72, 75]]	[]	['abd-A,', 'Abd-B', 'hox', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
333	In all four species examined, the PREs of the Bithorax complex were predicted at well-conserved positions (Figure 1A), with one notable exception: an extra PRE 10 kb upstream of abd-A is predicted in D.	[[34, 37], [156, 159]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
334	yakuba have PRE scores of less than 20 (Figure 1A, top three panels, asterisks) and have very few PRE motifs (Figure 4E)..	[[12, 15], [98, 101]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
335	The predicted extra D. pseudoobscura PRE was bound by PcG proteins in D.	[[54, 57], [37, 40]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
336	The orthologous sequences showed no detectable PcG binding in any of the other species, suggesting that this element does not function as a PRE in D.	[[47, 50], [140, 143]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
337	To test these observations by independent means, we generated transgenic reporter flies carrying either the predicted D. pseudoobscura PRE or the orthologous D.	[[135, 138]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
338	melanogaster sequence did not show any typical PRE behaviour in this assay, the D.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
339	pseudoobscura element showed pairing-sensitive silencing, variegation, and response to PcG and trxG mutations (Figure 4G and 4H), all typical features of PRE elements [4,52,53].	[[87, 90], [154, 157]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
340	Thus, we conclude that this extra D. pseudoobscura element is indeed a functional PRE..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
341	The presence of an additional functional PRE in the D.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
342	pseudoobscura Bithorax complex is intriguing, particularly since the positions of other PREs at this locus are so well conserved.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
343	This PRE may be a remnant of an ancestral Bithorax complex, which has lost the PRE at that position in some lineages. Alternatively, the D. pseudoobscura PRE may have arisen from nonfunctional sequence and been fixed by positive selection.	[[5, 8], [79, 82], [154, 157]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
344	To evaluate these two possibilities, PRE scores were calculated for the orthologous sequences at this position in eight Drosophila genomes [35].	[[37, 40]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
345	This analysis showed a statistically significant PRE score for this site in D.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
346	A maximum likelihood analysis suggests that the PRE was present in the common ancestor of the species under consideration and was lost in the melanogaster subgroup (Figure S3).	[[48, 51]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
347	To gain further insight into global gain and loss of PREs during the evolution of the D. melanogaster lineage, we carried out genome-wide comparisons with eight genomes as described in Materials and Methods.	[[53, 56]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
348	From this analysis, it can be inferred that 33 PREs have been gained in D.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
349	For only one of these 33 PREs, the nearest gene, scribbled (scrib; FBgn0026178), has another PRE, and gene CG12852 (FBgn0085383) has gained two PREs, without having a further one.	[[25, 28], [93, 96], [144, 147]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
350	Thus, 30 of these PREs are associated with genes that previously had no PRE.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
351	Taken together, these data indicate that PREs can arise from nonfunctional sequence, and furthermore suggest that genes can newly acquire PcG regulation..	[[138, 141], [41, 44]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
352	By using predictive methods that identify Drosophila PREs independent of their genomic position, in combination with experimental validation at selected loci, we document three kinds of evolutionary plasticity: the numbers of PRE elements, their motif composition, and their genomic position all change rapidly in evolution.	[[53, 56], [226, 229]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
353	By demonstrating that PRE evolution is not limited to the adaptation of preexisting elements [22], these findings document a novel dimension of cis-regulatory evolution..	[[22, 25]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
354	For the PREs that have changed position, there are several possible mechanisms by which a PRE may be lost from one site and gained at another, all of which may be at play in shifting the PRE landscape between species.	[[8, 11], [90, 93], [187, 190]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
355	For example, PREs may move by a simple microinversion event [54].	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
356	However, the evolutionary plasticity that we document here mainly involves the loss or gain of PRE function from orthologous sequences that do not contain inversions, thus other mechanisms must be considered.	[[95, 98]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
357	First, PREs may move by “creeping” from one site to the other.	[[7, 10]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
358	In this model, a sequence adjacent to a PRE may acquire new functional motifs, thus shifting the centre of PRE function to a slightly different location.	[[40, 43], [107, 110]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
359	By accumulation of such small shifts, the PRE could effectively move to a new position.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
360	We observe such an insertion in the salm PRE (Figure 3C and 3F), in which a single motif cluster spanning approximately 600 bp in the D.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
361	melanogaster PRE has split into two clusters in D.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
362	Second, ancestral PREs may lose their function at different sites in different lineages, resulting in an apparent change of position.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
363	Third, a PRE could change its position by de novo evolution from nonfunctional sequence.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
364	We infer from comparative genomics that this is the case for at least 35 PREs in D.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
365	This suggests that, as proposed [55], nonfunctional sequences may be “elected” to take up a role as PREs by relatively few nucleotide changes.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
366	We have examined this possibility for selected Drosophila PREs that occur at nonorthologous positions in different species by allowing single base changes in any motif and plotting sites of “pre-PRE” potential.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
367	We find that sites of PRE function in one species correspond to sites of high potential in a second species, so that a new PRE could theoretically emerge with very few nucleotide changes (Figure S5)..	[[22, 25], [123, 126]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
368	What is the evolutionary significance of PRE plasticity? Many studies of enhancers have shown that small differences in sequence can lead to large phenotypic differences [21,22,28–30], thus one may expect the same to be true for PREs.	[[41, 44], [229, 232]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
369	However, it is important to bear in mind one important functional difference between enhancers and PREs, namely that enhancers respond to differences in cellular concentrations of the transcription factors that bind them, whereas PREs respond to the activity state of their cognate promoter, and not to local differences in the concentrations of the PcG and TrxG proteins [8].	[[350, 353], [99, 102], [230, 233], [358, 362]]	[]	['PcG', 'PRE', 'PRE', 'TrxG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
370	Thus, PREs may be more tolerant than enhancers to changes in number of binding sites, and indeed to changes in the number of PREs at a given locus.	[[6, 9], [125, 128]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
371	It remains to be seen whether enhancers display evolutionary plasticity similar to that of PREs..	[[91, 94]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
372	Given the flexible nature of PRE design, we envision several possible effects of evolutionary plasticity, which may operate differently at different PREs.	[[29, 32], [149, 152]]	[]	['PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
373	First, many differences in PRE number and sequence between species may be tolerated by the organism without causing large phenotypic differences.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
374	Thus, some PREs may work to maintain phenotype in the face of environmental differences.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
375	melanogaster, the PcG proteins are profoundly sensitive to the temperature at which the flies are raised [52], giving more potent silencing at higher temperatures.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
376	Thus, for some PREs, the plasticity in design that we observe may play a role in “buffering” the system against different temperatures, such that the transcriptional output of the locus is conserved.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
377	In addition, PREs may mediate phenotypic plasticity for thermosensitive traits such as pigmentation. Several of the loci involved in the plasticity of pigmentation (e.g., Abd-B) are regulated by PREs [56]..	[[171, 176], [13, 16], [195, 198]]	[]	['Abd-B', 'PRE', 'PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
378	On the other hand, for some PREs, differences in design may have a direct effect on phenotype.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
379	Several studies have documented large effects on PRE function caused by changes in one or a few binding sites [44,57,58].	[[49, 52]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
380	Thus, we propose that some of the changes we observe would affect the silencing or activation response of the PRE, thus in turn affecting the level of target gene transcription that is maintained, and giving selectable effects on phenotype.	[[110, 113]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
381	Evolutionary diversity in sex comb number is associated with diversity in regulation of the hox gene Sex-combs reduced (Scr), which is a well-characterised target of PcG regulation [60,61].	[[92, 95], [166, 169]]	[]	['hox', 'PcG']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml
382	pseudoobscura Scr locus [54] has removed 3′ regulatory sequences, including one of a cluster of three Scr PREs, to a new position.	[[106, 109]]	[]	['PRE']	[]	PMC2573935.nxml

491	The mechanism by which the Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, Rad17, and RFC subunits mediate the checkpoint response is unclear, but one hypothesis is that the Rad17–Rfc2–Rfc3–Rfc4–Rfc5 (hereafter called RSR; Table 1) complex functions mechanistically similarly to RFC to load the PCNA-like protein complex Rad9–Hus1–Rad1 (hereafter called RHR) onto sites of damaged DNA in vivo.

493	cerevisiae RHR (Ddc1–Mec3–Rad17) was shown to form a sliding clamp on gapped circular DNA in an ATP hydrolysis- and RSR-dependent manner, the recombinant human RHR complex, in contrast, was found to be incapable of forming a sliding clamp on nicked circular DNA.

497	We show that the purified RSR complex can catalyze the loading of the RHR complex onto DNA in vitro in an ATP-, RPA-, and DNA structure-specific manner, and once loaded, the RHR complex, like PCNA, forms a sliding clamp.

548	In addition, loading of the clamp requires that the DNA substrate possess a DNA replication primer–template structure bound by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB, gp32, or RPA) (Tsurimoto and Stillman 1991; Tinker et al.	[[182, 185], [168, 171]]	[]	['RPA', 'SSB']	[]	PMC261875.nxml

555	Unexpectedly, however, RSR possessed the opposite substrate specificity (Figure 4B), since a DNA substrate with a recessed 5′ end was discovered to be a much better substrate for RHR loading (Figure 4B, lanes 11 and 12) compared to the recessed 3′ end substrate (Figure 4B, lanes 8 and 9).

561	Loading of the ring-shaped homotrimeric PCNA results in the topological linking of the complex to the DNA, and because of the absence of specific contacts with the DNA, the PCNA can freely translate or “slide” on duplex DNA (Kuriyan and O'Donnell 1993; Krishna et al.	[[40, 44], [173, 177]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
562	If loaded onto a circular substrate, the PCNA is trapped on the DNA, resulting in a very stable PCNA–DNA complex.	[[41, 45]]	[]	['PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
563	However, loading of PCNA onto linear DNA yields a very unstable PCNA–DNA complex because the PCNA can slide off the DNA unless the ends are blocked.	[[20, 24], [93, 97]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
564	In the assay described in Figure 1E, PCNA sliding off the substrate was presumably blocked by RPA binding on the single-stranded region of the DNA template (or 5′ end) and the biotin–streptavidin–agarose bead complex at the double-stranded end of template (or 3′ end, distal to RPA)..	[[37, 41], [94, 97], [278, 281]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
565	To test whether PCNA was topologically linked in this assay, we compared loading onto recessed 3′ end primer–template DNAs that contained the biotin-linked bead at either the double-stranded end (bead distal to RPA) or at the single-stranded end of the template (bead proximal to RPA) (Figure 5A).	[[16, 20], [211, 214], [280, 283]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
566	In contrast to the former substrate, the latter possesses one unblocked or “free” end that would allow the PCNA to slide off the duplex DNA.	[[107, 111]]	[]	['PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
567	Thus, if the PCNA was topologically linked to the DNA, very poor recovery of the clamp on this substrate was expected.	[[13, 17]]	[]	['PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
568	As predicted, although efficiently recovered on the DNA with the biotin bead complex distal to RPA (Figure 5A, lane 4; see also the experiment presented in Figure 4), PCNA was not recovered when the biotin bead complex was placed at the single-stranded end of the template (proximal to RPA) (Figure 5A, lane 8).	[[167, 171], [95, 98], [286, 289]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
569	Placement of the biotin at the single-stranded end of the DNA did not simply inhibit RFC activity, for ternary complex formation on both substrates in the presence of ATPγS was observed with similar efficiencies (Figure 5A, lanes 5 and 9).	[[167, 172], [85, 88]]	[]	['ATPγS', 'RFC']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
570	In addition, both the 5′ biotin and 3′ biotin substrates were capable of activating the ATPase activity of RFC with the same efficiency (data not shown), again indicating no specific impairment of RFC function by the 5′ biotin substrate.	[[107, 110], [197, 200]]	[]	['RFC', 'RFC']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
571	We concluded, therefore, that the inability to recover the PCNA by unblocking one end of the substrate was due to PCNA sliding off the duplex DNA after it was loaded.	[[59, 63], [114, 118]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
572	Thus, in this assay, the PCNA was topologically linked to the DNA..	[[25, 29]]	[]	['PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
573	Loading reactions in the experiments represented in (A) and (B) were performed as described in the Materials and Methods using either recessed 5′ or recessed 3′ primer–template DNA–RPA substrates bound to beads, and then recovery of proteins with the beads was analyzed by Wb for the indicated proteins.

576	In both (A) and (B), reactions were performed in the absence (lanes 3 and 7) or presence of nucleotide (ATP: lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8; ATPγS: lanes 5 and 9), and 20% of the reaction input was loaded in the lane labeled L..	[[104, 107], [131, 136]]	[]	['ATP', 'ATPγS']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
577	When RHR was analyzed for sliding clamp formation, poor recovery of the complex was observed on the DNA substrate with only one end of the DNA blocked (Figure 5B, lane 8) compared to that with both ends of the substrate blocked (Figure 5B, lane 4; see also the experiment presented in Figure 4).	[[5, 8]]	[]	['RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
578	In the presence of ATP, it is probable that multiple RHR complexes were loaded onto the duplex DNA that was blocked with a biotin-linked bead (Figure 5B, lane 4), whereas multiple RHR complexes loaded onto the same substrate with a free duplex DNA end failed to accumulate on the DNA because they slid off (Figure 5B, lane 8).	[[19, 22], [53, 56], [180, 183]]	[]	['ATP', 'RHR', 'RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
579	In contrast, in the presence of ATPγS ternary complex formation, but not clamp loading on both substrates occurred with similar efficiencies and therefore appeared to be unaffected by the location of the biotin bead complex (Figure 5B, lanes 5 and 9).	[[32, 37]]	[]	['ATPγS']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
580	Thus, when loaded onto DNA in the presence of ATP, like the PCNA clamp, RHR appeared to be topologically linked and formed a sliding clamp..	[[46, 49], [60, 64], [72, 75]]	[]	['ATP', 'PCNA', 'RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
581	To test whether RPA plays a role in clamp loading, RFC and RSR activities were analyzed in the presence of either human or yeast RPA.	[[51, 54], [16, 19], [59, 62]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
582	We surmised that if the only function of RPA in our assay was to block the ends of the substrate and thus prevent clamp sliding, then clamp loading should be supported with equal efficiency by yeast and human RPA.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
583	However, if RPA also functioned to stimulate clamp-loading activity, this activity may involve species-specific protein–protein interactions, given that yeast RPA does not substitute for human RPA in in vitro assays for either SV40 DNA replication or nucleotide excision repair (Wold 1997).	[[12, 15], [159, 162], [193, 196]]	[]	['RPA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
584	cerevisiae Rfc4 display allele-specific interactions with mutations in RPA1, which encodes the largest subunit of RPA (Kim and Brill 2001), and human RFC has been shown to directly interact with human RPA (Yuzhakov et al.	[[150, 153], [114, 117], [201, 204]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
585	When PCNA loading was analyzed in the presence of saturating levels of either yeast (Figure 6A, lanes 3–5) or human RPA (Figure 6A, lanes 6–9), recovery of the PCNA was poorer in the presence of yeast RPA compared to human RPA.	[[5, 9], [160, 164], [116, 119], [201, 204]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
586	Inefficient recovery of the PCNA was not due to an inability of yeast RPA to prevent human PCNA clamp sliding, because usage of alternative recessed 3′ end substrates in this assay permitted efficient and comparable PCNA recovery in the presence of yeast and human RPA (V.	[[28, 32], [91, 95], [216, 220], [70, 73], [265, 268]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA', 'PCNA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
587	Hence, recovery of the PCNA in the presence of yeast RPA was DNA structure specific and not due to an intrinsic (1) inability of yeast RPA to prevent human PCNA clamp sliding nor (2) human RFC inhibitory activity of yeast RPA.	[[23, 27], [156, 160], [189, 192], [53, 56], [135, 138]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA', 'RFC', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
588	Therefore, we concluded that RPA performed two functions in our assay: first, it prevented the clamp from sliding off the DNA, and second, it specifically stimulated the activity of RFC on canonical primer–template recessed 3′ end DNA substrates.	[[182, 185], [29, 32]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
589	Likewise, when yeast RPA was tested for the ability to support RHR loading (Figure 6B), RSR activity was found to be preferentially stimulated by human RPA (Figure 6B, lanes 5 and 6) compared to yeast RPA (Figure 6B, lanes 3 and 4).

590	Thus, the clamp loader functions of both RFC and RSR were modulated by interactions with RPA..	[[41, 44], [89, 92], [49, 52]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml

594	In (B), RHR loading was assayed in the absence of RPA (lane 2) or in the presence of the indicated amounts of either yeast RPA (lanes 3 and 4) or human RPA (lanes 5 and 6).	[[8, 11], [50, 53], [123, 126], [152, 155]]	[]	['RHR', 'RPA', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml

596	The potential functional similarities between RSR and RFC and between the RHR subunits and the PCNA subunit, respectively, have been noted (Sugimoto et al.	[[95, 99], [54, 57], [74, 77], [46, 49]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RFC', 'RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
597	cerevisiae Rfc5 were reported to result in a cell cycle checkpoint defect in response to DNA damage, and Rfc5 was found to interact both genetically and physically with Rad24, the large subunit of RSR in S.	[[197, 200]]	[]	['RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
598	pombe RHR subunits were first found to physically interact with each other and later shown to be PCNA-like proteins from secondary structure modeling (Kostrub et al.	[[97, 101], [6, 9]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
599	Although protein–protein interactions between the PCNA-like proteins and Rad17/Rad24 and RFC subunits have been described by several investigators (Kostrub et al.	[[50, 54], [89, 92]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RFC']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
600	In this report, we have presented direct evidence that RSR functions biochemically quite similarly to its archetype RFC.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
601	The purified RSR, isolated from human cells, was capable of loading the heterotrimeric RHR complex onto DNA in an ATP-, RPA-, and DNA structure-specific manner.	[[114, 117], [87, 90], [120, 123], [13, 16]]	[]	['ATP', 'RHR', 'RPA', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
602	Although the reactions executed by the RFC and RSR clamp loaders are similar, they require DNA substrates of the opposite polarity to load their respective clamps: RFC utilizes a recessed 3′ end, whereas RSR prefers a recessed 5′ end.	[[39, 42], [164, 167], [47, 50], [204, 207]]	[]	['RFC', 'RFC', 'RSR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
603	The use of a recessed 3′ end by RFC and PCNA makes sense since PCNA is a DNA polymerase clamp protein and the DNA polymerase utilizes the 3′-OH as a primer for DNA synthesis.	[[40, 44], [63, 67], [32, 35]]	[]	['PCNA', 'PCNA', 'RFC']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
604	The new observations provide insights into the function of RSR in the DNA damage-response pathway and suggest that the RHR clamp is not used by DNA polymerases on primer–template structures.	[[119, 122], [59, 62]]	[]	['RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
605	We have also characterized a recombinant source of the RSR complex purified from Sf9 cells and found it to be inactive.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
606	Recently, a recombinant source of the RSR complex also purified from Sf9 cells was reported to possess RHR-loading activity (Bermudez et al.	[[103, 106], [38, 41]]	[]	['RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
607	In contrast to the properties of the native protein we report here, the reaction executed by this recombinant protein was ATPγS dependent and did not result in the formation of a RHR complex that could slide on DNA, indicating that in their assay, the complex was not topologically linked to the DNA.

608	(2003) is ternary complex formation rather than clamp loading, given that the authors reported that (1) adenine nucleotide binding is sufficient for RSR to form a complex with RHR, and complex formation could be supported by not only ATP, but also ATPγS and ADP in the absence of DNA; and that (2) RSR can bind DNA in the absence of RHR and nucleotide.

610	cerevisiae, isolated from yeast, was recently reported to load its RHR clamp (Ddc1–Mec3–Rad17) onto DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, resulting in a Ddc1–Mec3–Rad17 complex that could slide on DNA (Majka and Burgers 2003).	[[110, 113], [67, 70]]	[]	['ATP', 'RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
611	In this report, using a circular substrate containing a 500 bp single-strand gap, clamp loading did not appear to be stimulated by RPA, although the authors did observe stimulation of the DNA-binding activity of the clamp loader and inhibition of clamp loading at ectopic or pseudosubstrates created by secondary structure in the single-stranded region of the substrate.	[[131, 134]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
612	coli single-strand DNA-binding protein SSB plays an important role by specifically binding the χ subunit of the γ complex and stimulating its activity (Kelman et al.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['SSB']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
613	The χ–SSB interaction was shown to ameliorate the salt sensitivity of clamp loading, replication fork assembly, and DNA synthesis by facilitating binding of the γ complex to DNA (Glover and McHenry 1998; Kelman et al.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['SSB']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
614	Furthermore, a SSB variant with reduced affinity for χ was shown to be unable to stimulate clamp loading and DNA synthesis (Kelman et al.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['SSB']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
615	Analogously, our comparison of the ability of yeast and human RPA to support PCNA loading suggested that an interaction between RPA and RFC was presumably conferred by specific amino acids in human RPA not present in yeast RPA.

616	We surmise that in the absence of a direct comparison of single-strand DNA-binding protein specificity as reported here, that stimulation of clamp loader activity by RPA may only be revealed by a careful analysis of the salt sensitivity of the clamp-loading reaction.	[[166, 169]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
617	Thus, perhaps the salt concentration in the experiment reported by Majka and Burgers (2003) was suboptimal to reveal this activity of RPA..	[[134, 137]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
618	Interestingly, we have observed that utilization of a substrate containing a frayed recessed 3′ end abrogates the stimulatory function of human RPA on RFC activity.	[[151, 154], [144, 147]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
619	Loading of PCNA using this substrate is supported by yeast and human RPA equivalently, and the efficiency of this loading is equivalent to the loading onto a completely base-paired recessed 3′ end substrate (V.	[[11, 15], [69, 72]]	[]	['PCNA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
620	Hence, the ability for RFC to load its clamp onto a recessed 3′ end in the presence of yeast RPA is not due to an inhibitory activity nor an inability to prevent the clamp from sliding off the DNA.	[[23, 26], [93, 96]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
621	This idea is consistent with the previous reports demonstrating that the γ complex and human RFC can load their clamps onto supercoiled plasmid substrates that lack free ends but contain distortions in the DNA and/or regions of partially unwound DNA (Podust et al.	[[93, 96]]	[]	['RFC']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
622	The step in this pathway that requires the function of RSR and RHR (also referred to as checkpoint clamp loader and clamp, respectively) is unclear.	[[63, 66], [55, 58]]	[]	['RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
623	A requirement for Rad17 for RHR complex localization to damaged chromatin in human cells was demonstrated by inhibiting Rad17 protein expression by small interfering RNA (Zou et al.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
624	2001), it was suggested that the RHR clamp and the RSR clamp loader may function as initial sensors of DNA damage.	[[33, 36], [51, 54]]	[]	['RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
625	This model, however, is inconsistent with our findings revealing a requirement for a 5′ recessed primer–template substrate and RPA for loading of the RHR complex by the RSR clamp loader.	[[150, 153], [127, 130], [169, 172]]	[]	['RHR', 'RPA', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
626	cerevisiae RPA has been shown to genetically interact with Rfc4, and allele-specific mutants in RPA that abolish the interaction with RFC in vitro have been shown to confer a DNA damage checkpoint-deficient phenotype in vivo (Kim and Brill 2001).	[[134, 137], [11, 14], [96, 99]]	[]	['RFC', 'RPA', 'RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
627	In addition, activation of the S-phase DNA damage checkpoint in a Xenopus cell-free DNA replication system resulted in RPA- and polα/primase-dependent loading of Xenopus Rad17 and Hus1 proteins onto damaged chromatin (You et al.	[[119, 122]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
628	All of these structures have 5′ recessed ends and RPA could bind to the single-stranded DNA.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
629	We further suggest that a modified version of RPA would be primarily responsible for recruiting the checkpoint clamp loader and the clamp to these sites.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['RPA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
630	Given that RSR loads RHR (depicted as a ring or donut encircling the DNA) onto recessed 5′ ends in vitro, recessed 5′ ends generated in vivo in the depicted pathways can be considered potential substrates.	[[21, 24], [11, 14]]	[]	['RHR', 'RSR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
631	The RHR clamp is proposed to protect the recessed 5′ end from extensive degradation by exonucleases and to promote resolution of these structures back to duplex DNA..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
632	A potential participant in the DNA damage recognition step of the checkpoint pathway is the Mec1/Lcd1 kinase complex (corresponding to the ATM and ATR/ATRIP [Cortez et al.	[[139, 142], [154, 156]]	[]	['ATM', 'IP']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
633	Thus, in the absence of DNA damage, we envision the Mec1/ATR/ATM kinase and checkpoint clamp and clamp loader complexes functioning as auxiliary replication fork components that respond to changes in replication fork progression and promote fork stability in S-phase to ensure proper coupling of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['ATM']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
634	In response to damage outside of S-phase, a Mec1/ATR/ATM-dependent step may contribute to the creation of a specific DNA structure for loading of the checkpoint clamp (Rouse and Jackson 2002a), which then protects the recessed 5′ end and facilitates DNA repair by recruiting components of the apparatus required for recombination-dependent DNA replication pathways..	[[53, 56]]	[]	['ATM']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
635	It is well established that PCNA functions as a processivity factor or tether for DNA-modifying enzymes that are involved in a variety of biochemical pathways, from DNA replication and repair to nucleosome assembly, and in the establishment of specialized DNA structures such as heterochromatin (Zhang et al.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['PCNA']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
636	However, the proteins recruited to DNA by RHR are not known.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['RHR']	[]	PMC261875.nxml
637	Notwithstanding, given the DNA structure onto which the RHR clamp is loaded by its clamp loader, potential ligands become quite evident, as recessed 5′ ends are generated in many biochemical processes, including recombinational repair and telomere maintenance (Figure 7).

756	When coexpressed with p35 and GFP using ptcGAL4, Slikkd caused an increase in the number of GFP-expressing cells and an increase in the number of cells that incorporated BrdU (Figure 9C).	[[170, 174], [30, 33], [92, 95]]	[]	['BrdU', 'GFP', 'GFP']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
757	In addition to the increased proliferation of the disc epithelium caused by Slik or Slikkd overexpression, we noted a striking increase in cell proliferation in the overlying peripodial cell layer, reflected by increased nuclear density and BrdU incorporation (Figure 9D–9I).	[[241, 245]]	[]	['BrdU']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
758	This suggests that slik overexpression in the columnar epithelium led to production of a signal that was able to stimulate proliferation of cells in the peripodial layer.	[[19, 23]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
759	A few Ste20 group kinases have been shown to act as upstream activators of MAPK-type pathways by regulating MAP3K activity (Dan et al.	[[108, 113], [6, 11]]	[]	['MAP3K', 'Ste20']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
760	To determine whether slik function involves activation of MAPK signaling, we tested the ability of mutants in two Drosophila MAPK-type pathways (those mediated by JNK and ERK) to suppress slik-driven tissue growth.	[[171, 174], [21, 25], [188, 192]]	[]	['ERK', 'slik', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
761	We observed limited modulation of slik-driven overgrowth in animals heterozygous for mutations in the JNKK hep, the JNK basket, the transcription factor jun, or the JNK phosphatase puc (20% or less).	[[181, 184], [34, 38]]	[]	['puc', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
762	In contrast, slik showed strong genetic interactions with upstream components of the ERK pathway.	[[85, 88], [13, 17]]	[]	['ERK', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
763	Removing one copy of the Drosophila MAP3K Raf using the null allele phlEA75 completely suppressed the effects of slik-driven overgrowth, restoring the wings to a wild-type appearance (Figure 10A and 10B).	[[36, 41], [113, 117]]	[]	['MAP3K', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
764	A deficiency removing the Drosophila ERK Rolled had only a modest effect (15%).	[[37, 40]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
765	These observations raise the possibility that ERK may not be a major effector of Slik in promoting cell proliferation, although Raf appears to be one (see below)..	[[46, 49]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
766	If Raf acts as a downstream effector of Slik, we would expect removing one copy of the raf gene to enhance the severity of slik mutant phenotypes.	[[123, 127]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
767	Removing one copy of raf reduced the viability of the slik hypomorphs to approximately 40% and increased the penetrance of their wing phenotype from 39% to nearly 100%.	[[54, 58]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
768	Clones of GFP-expressing slik1 mutant cells were much smaller than their wild-type twin clones.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
769	Comparable experiments expressing an activated form of ERK (RlSEM) did not suppress the survival defect of slik1 mutant clones (Figure 10G).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
770	The level of ERK activity generated by this transgene was sufficient to elicit the high threshold ERK response of vein formation.	[[13, 16], [98, 101]]	[]	['ERK', 'ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
771	Thus, the failure to suppress cell death in slik mutant clones cannot be attributed to insufficient ERK activity (discussed below).	[[100, 103], [44, 48]]	[]	['ERK', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
772	These observations indicate that activation of Raf can suppress the survival defect and promote proliferation of slik1 mutant cells and suggest that Raf does not act via the canonical ERK MAPK pathway to do so.	[[184, 187]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
773	These differences may explain the strong genetic interactions between Slik and Raf mutants and the very limited genetic interaction between Slik and ERK (Rolled) mutants..	[[149, 152]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
774	The relationship between Slik and Raf resembles that reported for the Ste20 kinase germinal center kinase (GCK) and the MAP3K MEKK1 in that GCK binds to MEKK1 and activates it in a kinase-independent manner (Chadee et al.

775	We examined the level of ERK phosphorylation in S2 cells transfected to overexpress Slik or Slikkd.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
776	Taken together with the finding that expression of activated ERK cannot rescue the slik mutant survival defect in vivo, these findings suggest that Raf does not act via the canonical ERK MAPK pathway to mediate Slik's activity in supporting cell survival and promoting cell proliferation..

778	Loss of slik function results in a larval growth defect characterized by slow growth and a decreased rate of endoreplicative cell cycling in polyploid larval cells, developmental delay, and eventually death.	[[8, 12]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
779	The behavior of slik mutant clones suggests that diploid cells lacking slik proliferate more slowly than normal and are eliminated by apoptosis.	[[16, 20], [71, 75]]	[]	['slik', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml

783	Signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) act via the small GTPase Ras to activate Raf (Schlessinger 2000).	[[40, 43]]	[[13, 37]]	['RTK']	['receptor tyrosine kinase']	PMC261876.nxml
784	Some members of the Ste20 kinase family act as MAP4Ks to activate Raf and other MAP3Ks, whereas others act in a kinase-independent manner (reviewed in Dan et al.	[[80, 85], [20, 25]]	[]	['MAP3K', 'Ste20']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
785	The Ste20 protein GCK activates MEKK1 in a kinase-independent manner to transduce signals from TNF family receptors via the JNK pathway.	[[18, 21], [4, 9]]	[]	['GCK', 'Ste20']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
786	Our finding that the proliferative effects of Slik and its ability to bind Raf are independent of its kinase activity suggests that Slik activates Raf as a consequence of binding, perhaps by oligomerization, as has been suggested for GCK and MEKK1..	[[234, 237]]	[]	['GCK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
787	A wild-type slik transgene rescued the mutant to viability under comparable conditions.	[[12, 16]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
788	For example, rescue of the slik mutant cell-survival defect by expression of p35 or activated Raf did not prevent cells from exhibiting an abnormal arrangement of actin and dropping out of the disc epithelium.	[[27, 31]]	[]	['slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml

790	Although Slik is not a core component of the ERK pathway, our findings suggest that Slik activates Raf to control cell survival and cell proliferation.	[[45, 48]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
791	What are the differences between RTK-mediated and Slik-mediated activation of Raf? The growth and survival functions of the ERK pathway are thought to require low-intensity signaling (Baker and Yu 2001; Halfar et al.	[[124, 127], [33, 36]]	[]	['ERK', 'RTK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
792	Stronger Raf-dependent ERK activation is required for cell fate specification in response to high-threshold EGFR signaling.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
793	Repeated cycles of strong ERK activation are responsible for sequential cell fate specification events in the eye imaginal disc (Freeman 1996).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
794	High-level activation of ERK specifies vein cell fate in the wing disc (as visualized by antibody to doubly phosphorylated ERK; Gabay et al.	[[25, 28], [123, 126]]	[]	['ERK', 'ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
795	Activation of ERK in proliferating wing cells is not detectable by this antibody.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
796	Elevated Slik expression stimulates cell proliferation, but does not cause a detectable increase in the level of ERK phosphorylation in S2 cells (data not shown).	[[113, 116]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
797	This suggests that Slik-mediated activation of Raf is not required for high-threshold ERK responses..	[[86, 89]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
798	However, a deficiency removing ERK had little effect in the same assay.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
799	It may be that that ERK levels are not limiting because Slik is involved only in low-level ERK activation.	[[20, 23], [91, 94]]	[]	['ERK', 'ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
800	Alternatively, Slik may regulate Raf- and MEK-dependent survival and proliferation independently of ERK.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['MEK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
801	This view is supported by our finding that activation of Raf is able to replace the requirement for Slik and support survival of slik mutant cells, whereas activation of ERK is not able to do so.	[[170, 173], [129, 133]]	[]	['ERK', 'slik']	[]	PMC261876.nxml
802	There is increasing evidence supporting an ERK-independent function of Raf proteins, particularly in the regulation of cell survival/apoptosis (reviewed in Hindley and Kolch 2002).	[[43, 46]]	[]	['ERK']	[]	PMC261876.nxml

822	One of the reasons for this is that, in many sensory systems, in-growing sensory axons are marshalled to form a clear anatomical map of peripheral characteristics in the central nervous system (CNS) (for reviews, see Knudsen 2002; Keller and Vosshall 2003; McLaughlin et al.	[[194, 197]]	[[170, 192]]	['CNS']	['central nervous system']	PMC261881.nxml

824	The map is repeated in a parasegmental fashion along the CNS, which leads us to believe that boundaries in the CNS and the cues that organise the map may be established as a result of events early in development as the embryo subdivides itself into a series of parasegmental units..

891	Because ISN and SN motor neurons lie at different positions in the CNS and their axons grow out into the muscle field through different nerves, it is reasonable to suppose that at least the major subdivision of dendritic arborisations into internal and external domains could be a byproduct of the locations at which the motor neurons are generated and the paths taken by their growing axons.

956	Despite these initial results, several fundamental issues regarding the operation of BMIs, ranging from basic electrophysiological issues to multiple engineering bottlenecks, remain a matter of considerable debate (Nicolelis 2001, 2003; Donoghue 2002).	[[85, 88]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
957	For example, although most agree that a BMI designed to reproduce arm/hand movements will require long-term and stable recordings from cortical (or subcortical) neurons through chronically implanted electrode arrays (Nicolelis 2001, 2003; Donoghue 2002), there is considerable disagreement on what type of brain signal (single unit, multiunit, or field potentials [Pesaran et al.

959	Up to now, animal studies have demonstrated the capability of extracting a single motor parameter (e.g., hand trajectory, position, direction of movement) from brain activity in order to operate a BMI (Wessberg et al.	[[197, 200]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
960	While it is well known that cortical neuronal activity can encode a variety of motor parameters (Fetz 1992; Messier and Kalaska 2000; Johnson 2001), it is not clear which cortical areas would provide the best input for a BMI designed to restore multiple features of upper-limb function.

963	Another important issue that has received little attention is how the interposition of an artificial actuator (such as a robot arm) in the control loop impacts the BMI and the subject's performance.	[[164, 167]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
964	Two previous studies have reported that macaque monkeys learn to operate a closed-loop BMI (BMIc) using visual feedback (Serruya et al.	[[87, 90], [92, 96]]	[]	['BMI', 'BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
965	A possibility of such reorganization is supported by results in plasticity in M1 neurons in a force-field adaptation task (Li et al.	[[78, 80]]	[]	['M1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1002	By the end of 42 sessions, however, the mean contribution of neurons located in other cortical areas (e.g., SMA, PMd, and S1) was as high as that of M1.	[[113, 116], [122, 124], [108, 111]]	[]	['PMd', 'S1', 'SMA']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1003	This selectivity coincided with the use of a position model in the BMIc during these 42 sessions.	[[67, 71]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1006	As animals learned to operate the BMIc, we also observed short-term changes in neuronal directional tuning, within a single recording session, after switching the BMIc mode of operation from pole to brain control.	[[34, 38], [163, 167]]	[]	['BMIc', 'BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1007	Directional tuning curves (DTCs) reflected dependency of the neuronal firing rate on movement direction of either the pole or the cursor.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1008	DTCs were normalized by dividing average firing rates for particular movement directions by the standard deviation of the whole firing rate record and then subtracting the DTC mean.	[[172, 175]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1009	Average directional tuning of neural ensembles (DTE) was also assessed, and the spread of the preferred tuning directions was evaluated as the ensemble average of the angles between preferred directions in pairs of neurons.	[[48, 51]]	[[8, 45]]	['DTE']	['directional tuning of neural ensemble']	PMC261882.nxml
1010	Color-coded population histograms (Figure 4A–4D) displayed the DTCs of all recorded neurons.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1011	Polar plots (magenta figures in Figure 4A–4D) showed the DTE and preferred direction spread.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1012	Figure 4A–4D shows that DTCs and DTEs for the same neural ensemble had distinct features during pole control (Figure 4A), during brain control with the presence of arm movements (Figure 4B and 4D), and during brain control without arm movements (Figure 4C).	[[24, 27], [33, 36]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1013	Even if the animal was still making arm movements after switching to brain control and direction tuning was calculated in relation to pole movements (compare Figure 4A with 4D), DTC and DTE changed significantly when compared to curves obtained during pole control (R = 0.57 using pole movements as a reference direction, R = 0.70 using cursor movements as a reference).	[[178, 181], [186, 189]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1014	The changes in DTC and DTE became greater as the animal ceased to produce arm movements in brain control (Figure 4C) (R = 0.48).	[[15, 18], [23, 26]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1016	Further, as animals started controlling the BMIc without producing overt hand movements, directional tuning primarily reflected cursor movements.	[[44, 48]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1017	Interestingly, during the transition from pole to brain control, directional tuning depth (DTD) was reduced for most cells.	[[91, 94]]	[[65, 89]]	['DTD']	['directional tuning depth']	PMC261882.nxml
1018	Figure 4E–4G shows this effect by comparing the DTD in individual neurons during pole control (Y axis of Figure 4E–4G) and brain control (X axis).	[[48, 51]]	[]	['DTD']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1019	Operating the BMIc without making movements was characterized by an appearance of peculiar patterns of directional tuning at the population level.	[[14, 18]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1020	Figure 5A and 5C displays the evolution of DTC and DTE for the same neural ensemble during four task 1 sessions with the robot in the loop.	[[43, 46], [51, 54]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1021	Whereas in each case DTCs during brain control resembled those in pole control, they evolved toward a more organized distribution.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1022	Although certain diversity in DTCs remained, clear groups of neurons sharing similar DTCs appeared as a result of training (Figure 5C).	[[30, 33], [85, 88]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1023	This effect was also evident in the polar plots showing population-average tuning (i.e., DTE).	[[89, 92]]	[]	['DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1024	The DTE became progressively sharper and rotated clockwise.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1025	Throughout the four sessions depicted in Figure 5, tuning depth remained higher during pole than brain control operation of the BMIc (Figure 5B)..	[[128, 132]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1028	The population histograms of Figure 5D show that the distribution of DTCs, although variable, became on average tighter across all cortical areas, defining a vertical band across the population histogram.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1029	Similarity of DTCs during brain control indicated that particular movement directions were associated with simultaneous increases in activity in many neurons; i.e., firing rates of these neurons became more correlated.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1030	All cortical areas tested (M1, PMD, SMA, S1, and M1 ipsilateral) showed increases in correlated firing.	[[27, 29], [49, 51], [41, 43], [36, 39]]	[]	['M1', 'M1', 'S1', 'SMA']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1031	The highest within-area increases from pole to brain control were observed in M1 (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.07), S1 (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.05), and PMd (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.03).	[[78, 80], [132, 135], [103, 105]]	[]	['M1', 'PMd', 'S1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1032	The highest between-area increases were observed between M1–S1 (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.06, M1–PMd (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.04), PMd–S1 (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.04), M1–SMA (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.02), and M1contra–M1ipsi (ΔBrain-Pole = 0.02)..

1033	When the monkey controlled the BMI without moving the arm, the average neuronal firing rates decreased 2.5% from pole-control level..	[[31, 34]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1034	Contribution of contralateral M1 (R = 0.77, slope = 0.02, p < 0.05) and S1 (R = 0.85, slope = 0.02, p < 0.002) increased significantly, while that of PMd (R = 0.19, slope = 2 × 10−3), SMA (R = 0.34, slope = 0.01), and ipsilateral M1 (R = 0.38, slope = −0.01) did not change substantially.

1035	By comparing Figure 3B–3F and Figure 6B, we can see that while M1 and S1 neurons showed changes during both tasks 1 and 2, PMd and SMA neurons showed changes in task 1, but not in task 2.	[[63, 65], [123, 126], [70, 72], [131, 134]]	[]	['M1', 'PMd', 'S1', 'SMA']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1037	Each horizontal row represents a PETH for a single-neuron or multiunit activity.	[[33, 37]]	[]	['PETH']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1038	Note the general similarity of PETHs in pole (left) and brain (right) control in this relatively easy task.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['PETH']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1039	Note that during both modes of BMIc operation, the patterns of reaching and grasping movements (displacement followed by force increase) were preserved..	[[31, 35]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1040	Our experiments demonstrated, to our knowledge for the first time, that monkeys can learn to control a BMIc to produce a combination of reaching and grasping movements to locate and grasp virtual objects.	[[103, 107]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1041	The DTD of cortical neurons, measured during pole control, increased almost linearly during the learning of task 3 (Figure 6C).	[[4, 7]]	[]	['DTD']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1042	The most prominent increase in DTD was observed in M1 (red dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.81, slope = 0.02).	[[31, 34], [51, 53]]	[]	['DTD', 'M1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1043	Neurons in S1 (green dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.82, slope = 0.02) and ipsilateral M1 (magenta dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.81, slope = 0.02) exhibited the next largest increase.	[[80, 82], [11, 13]]	[]	['M1', 'S1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1044	Relatively smaller DTD increases were observed in PP (cyan dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.73, slope = 0.01), SMA (black dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.63, slope = 0.01), and PMd (blue dots in Figure 6C; R = 0.51, slope = 0.01).

1045	As in task 1, the DTC and DTE patterns changed during training (data not shown).	[[18, 21], [26, 29]]	[]	['DTC', 'DTE']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1046	In the display of hand trajectories, the size of the disc at the end of each hand movement shows the gripping force produced by the monkey (Figure 6F) or by the BMIc (Figure 6G) to grasp a virtual object.	[[161, 165]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1047	Thus, our goal to train the monkey to reproduce coupled sequences of reach-and-grasp movements using the BMIc was accomplished..	[[105, 109]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1048	Reliable, long-term operation of a BMIc was achieved by extracting multiple motor parameters (i.e., hand position, hand velocity, and gripping force) from the simultaneously recorded activity of frontopariental neural ensembles.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1049	Macaque monkeys learned to use the BMIc to reach and grasp virtual objects with a robot even in the absence of overt arm movements.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1050	We suggest that, in principle, any of these areas could be used to operate a BMI, provided that a large enough neuronal sample was obtained.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1051	While analysis of ND curves (see Figure 2D–2F) indicates that a significant sample of M1 neurons consistently provides the best predictions of all motor parameters analyzed, neurons in areas such as SMA, S1, PMd, and PP contribute to BMI performance as well..	[[234, 237], [86, 88], [18, 20], [208, 211], [217, 219], [204, 206], [199, 202]]	[]	['BMI', 'M1', 'ND', 'PMd', 'PP', 'S1', 'SMA']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1052	Then, a BMI that relies on only very small samples of neurons (e.g., 8–30 cells) (Serruya et al.	[[8, 11]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1053	Another important finding of this study is that accurate real-time prediction of all motor parameters as well as a high level of BMI control can be obtained from multiunit signals.	[[129, 132]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1054	Our experiments also demonstrate that the initial introduction of a mechanical device, such as the robot arm, in the control loop of a BMIc significantly impacts learning and task performance.	[[135, 139]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1055	At a single-neuron level, one modification observed was a reduction in the strength of directional tuning as animals switched from pole to brain control of the BMI, an effect that reached its maximum as animals ceased to produce overt arm movements.	[[160, 163]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1056	For example, a small fraction of M1 and S1 neurons became better directionally tuned when the monkey did not make hand movements during brain control (see Figure 4Ba–4Bd and Figure 5G).	[[33, 35], [40, 42]]	[]	['M1', 'S1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1057	Moreover, during brain control there was a significant increase in pairwise-correlated firing and a tendency for groups of neurons to exhibit rather similar DTCs (see Figures 4 and 5).	[[157, 160]]	[]	['DTC']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1058	All together, these physiological changes suggest that as animals learn to operate the BMI during brain control, visual feedback signals representing the goal of movement, rather than information about arm movements per se, become the main guiding signal to the cortical neurons that drive the BMIc.	[[87, 90]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1059	In other words, we propose that the gradual increase in behavioral performance during brain control of the BMI emerged as a consequence of a plastic reorganization whose main outcome was the assimilation of the dynamics of an artificial actuator into the physiological properties of frontoparietal neurons.	[[107, 110]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1060	Our results on cortical reorganization are very distinct from a previous claim of plastic changes in directional tuning of cortical cells during the use of BMI (Taylor et al.	[[156, 159]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1061	First, in that previous report, the population vector model yielded poor predictions when applied to activity of a small sample (n = 18) of M1 cells.	[[140, 142]]	[]	['M1']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1062	Introduction of visual feedback improved the subject's performance to a point in which monkeys could use a BMI to produce stereotypic center-out movements of a cursor.	[[107, 110]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC261882.nxml
1063	Overall, the present findings demonstrate that it is reasonable to envision that a cortical neuroprosthesis for restoring upper-limb movements could be implemented in the future, following the basic BMIc principles described here.	[[199, 203]]	[]	['BMIc']	[]	PMC261882.nxml

1074	Although signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has been studied extensively, the roles of individual signaling proteins downstream of these receptors are a matter of debate.	[[59, 62]]	[[32, 56]]	['RTK']	['receptor tyrosine kinase']	PMC261889.nxml
1075	Because many of these conclusions have been reached in diverse cell types and through the analysis of different RTKs, it is difficult to determine whether results from one receptor system can be used to generalize the functions of RTK signaling..

1077	In contrast, similar experiments on platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) signaling mutants have demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and Src family kinase (SFK) signal transduction pathways play roles in oligodendrocyte development (Klinghoffer et al.

1078	These phosphorylated tyrosines become binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins that initiate a number of signal transduction pathways (reviewed by Claesson-Welsh 1994; Heldin et al.	[[56, 66]]	[]	['SH2 domain']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1086	These results explain why defective PDGF signal transduction results in a reduction of the v/p cell lineage and ultimately in perinatal lethality due to vessel instability (Hellström et al.	[[36, 40], [91, 94]]	[]	['PDGF', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1087	To examine the roles of PI3K and PLCγ downstream of the PDGFRβ, we have previously disrupted their binding sites in the receptor's cytoplasmic domain (Heuchel et al.	[[24, 28], [33, 37]]	[]	['PI3K', 'PLCγ']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1091	Previous studies of the PDGFRβ have revealed an essential role for this receptor in v/p development, but attempts to identify essential biochemical signals thus far have demonstrated that loss of certain signaling pathways only diminishes PDGFRβ-driven responses (Heuchel et al.

1100	The XlacZ4 transgenic mouse expresses nuclear β-galactosidase in certain populations of differentiated, nonproliferating v/p cells in the embryo and the adult (Tidhar et al.	[[121, 124]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1102	The lack of any pathological phenotype in these tissues suggests either that the reduction in v/p cells is less severe than in the case of the PDGFRβ null mice, that the PDGFRα may be coexpressed in these same tissues, or that these tissues can function adequately even with reduced v/p cell numbers..	[[94, 97], [283, 286]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1103	Because some populations of v/p cells appear to be more dependent on PDGFRβ signal transduction than others, we reasoned that the PDGFRα might be coexpressed in the less-affected v/p populations.	[[28, 31], [179, 182]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1105	We crossed the PDGFRαGFP line of mouse, which expresses a nuclear-localized green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the PDGFRα promoter (Hamilton et al.	[[21, 24], [103, 106]]	[[76, 101]]	['GFP', 'GFP']	['green fluorescent protein']	PMC261889.nxml

1110	To determine whether the reduction in v/p was caused by a gradual loss or a developmental defect, we examined pericyte populations in wild-type and mutant embryos.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1112	We chose to observe pericytes at E14.5 because at this timepoint v/p are abundant in wild-type animals in several tissues, including the developing spinal cord and intercostal vasculature.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1117	Because the F7 is the most severely affected allele, it is possible that the difference between the heart and kidney levels is due to a developmental delay in v/p formation.	[[159, 162]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1118	At the more mature level of the heart, the F7/F7 pericyte populations have reached a steady-state level and resemble v/p numbers more similar to those observed in the F5/F5 embryos..	[[117, 120]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1119	Previously, chimeric analysis had demonstrated that PDGFRβ heterozygous cells do not contribute extensively to the smooth muscle cell compartment, suggesting that heterozygous cells may have reduced v/p developmental potential (Crosby et al.	[[199, 202]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1120	To find out whether receptor levels had any impact on v/p cells in our system, we crossed animals bearing the PDGFRβ null allele to our mutant series (Figures 5B and 6B).	[[54, 57]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1121	While most of the F series alleles demonstrate a decrease in v/p cells, the F1 allele results in an apparent increase in spinal cord pericytes.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1122	The second is that v/p numbers may not be tightly controlled and that PDGFRβ signaling can result in more cells..	[[19, 22]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1123	To determine whether the signaling pathways affected other v/p populations in the same manner, we have examined the v/p population in the retina.	[[59, 62], [116, 119]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1124	Even without the ability to quantitate these differences, it is clear that the PDGFRβ+/−, F5/F5, F7/F7, F5/−, and F7/− mutant retinas have a reduction in v/p when compared to wild-type eyes, reinforcing the requirement for multiple PDGFRβ signal transduction pathways in v/p development..	[[154, 157], [271, 274]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1125	A final tissue where we have examined v/p formation is the heart.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1126	In contrast, the F1/+ mice appeared to have more extensive v/p coating on their coronary arteries (Figure 9).	[[59, 62]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1127	In agreement with the data from the nervous system and the eye, the F5 and F7 mutant alleles have a significant reduction in v/p cells..	[[125, 128]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1128	Finally, although SH2 domain-containing proteins impact v/p numbers, the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor may play a role in transmitting the PDGFRβ signal because the truncation mutation does not exhibit any rescue of v/p development, while the F7 mutant allele that transmits primarily through kinase activity (owing to loss of the SH2 domain-containing protein-binding sites) still supports v/p development sufficient for viability..

1135	In contrast, in the F7/F7 MEFs, we did not observe any increase in Src activation.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1136	Examination of the v/p population demonstrates a quantitative relationship between the extent that signals are being transduced and the number of v/p that form.	[[19, 22], [146, 149]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1137	The second influence on PDGFRβ signal transmission is by the number of associated SH2 domain-containing proteins.	[[82, 92]]	[]	['SH2 domain']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1138	Loss of even a single pathway results in reduction of v/p, and as the number of disrupted pathways increases, there is a concomitant decrease in v/p.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1139	These signaling differences as illustrated by v/p number and the presence of vascular pathologies can be categorized in the mutant alleles by the following hierarchy: F1 > wild-type > F2 = F3 > F5 > F7 > null.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1140	In addition, hemizygotes show an even further reduction in v/p when compared to the F series homozygotes.	[[59, 62]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1141	In support of the observation that receptor levels and kinase activity may have a direct role in signal transduction, we have observed that a chimeric PDGFR that has the extracellular domain of the PDGFRβ but the intracellular domain of the PDGFRα exhibits a more severe phenotype than the F5 allele (Klinghoffer et al.	[[151, 156]]	[]	['PDGFR']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1142	The PDGFRβ's signaling pathways appears to dictate the absolute numbers of v/p that form, but how the individual pathways contribute to this phenotype remains to be tested.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1143	In fact, very little difference in numbers of v/p is observed between the F2 and the F3 mutants, suggesting that PLCγ signals may be somehow redundant with or dependent on the PI3K pathway.	[[176, 180], [113, 117], [46, 49]]	[]	['PI3K', 'PLCγ', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1144	The difference between the F3 and the F5 mutations is the ability to bind SHP-2 and RasGAP, and it has been proposed that both of these molecules play roles in downregulating the PDGFRβ signal (Klinghoffer and Kazlauskas 1995; Ekman et al.	[[74, 79]]	[]	['SHP-2']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1145	There are several potential ways that loss of these signaling pathways leads to v/p reduction.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1146	1996), whereas PI3K activity could be more important for migration (Kundra et al.	[[15, 19]]	[]	['PI3K']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1147	Therefore, the combined loss of these pathways results in a net reduction in v/p, albeit for entirely different cellular reasons.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1148	Our data suggest that PI3K may be a principal pathway, while the other pathways may be less significant.	[[22, 26]]	[]	['PI3K']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1149	The F2/F2 mutant mice have a significant reduction in v/p numbers when compared to the wild-type and the heterozygous mice, and additional mutations have less of an effect than PI3K on v/p numbers.	[[177, 181], [54, 57], [185, 188]]	[]	['PI3K', 'v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1150	2002): the phenotype of mouse embryos with loss of the PDGFRα–PI3K pathway was just as severe as that of embryos expressing a PDGFRα F7 allele (which is similar to the F7 allele of the PDGFRβ).	[[62, 66]]	[]	['PI3K']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1151	The pathological difference observed between the F5 and F7 alleles versus all of the other mutations suggests that SHP-2, SFK, Grb2, and RasGAP also impact pericyte development.	[[122, 125], [115, 120]]	[]	['SFK', 'SHP-2']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1152	The only signaling differences between the F3 mutation and the F5 mutation are the SHP-2 and RasGAP pathways.	[[83, 88]]	[]	['SHP-2']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1153	This apparent contradiction may indicate that RasGAP plays both a positive and a negative role in signal transduction or that SHP-2 may have mainly a positive role in modulating this response..	[[126, 131]]	[]	['SHP-2']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1154	Although we find that overall loss of downstream pathways attenuates receptor actions as demonstrated by v/p formation, it is surprising that the F7/F7 mice do not phenocopy the null animals.	[[105, 108]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1155	The remaining tyrosines are capable of binding SFKs, STATs, and Grbs.	[[47, 50], [53, 57]]	[]	['SFK', 'STAT']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1156	Based on several previous reports, disruption of Y578 affects the majority of SFK binding (Mori et al.	[[78, 81]]	[]	['SFK']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1157	1997), and we have shown that SFKs do not become activated after stimulation of the F7 receptor.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['SFK']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1158	As for the signaling roles of STAT and Grb2 downstream of the receptor, little direct function has been demonstrated for these remaining effector molecules in PDGF-induced cellular responses (Heldin et al.	[[159, 163], [30, 34]]	[]	['PDGF', 'STAT']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1159	Therefore, F7 signal transmission must use some other means than direct binding by SH2 domain-containing proteins.	[[83, 93]]	[]	['SH2 domain']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1160	The receptor should still have full kinase activity, unlike the lethal βT mutation, which is lacking half of the kinase domain and the SHP-2- and PLCγ-binding sites.	[[146, 150], [135, 140]]	[]	['PLCγ', 'SHP-2']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1161	The most likely surrogate is the PDGFRα, but we have demonstrated that in several of the v/p cell populations the PDGFRα is not expressed.	[[89, 92]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1162	While all of the other mutations appear to have a detrimental effect on PDGFRβ signal transduction, the F1 mutation results in an apparent increase in PDGFRβ activity as determined by v/p incidence.	[[184, 187]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1163	These data are in agreement with previous observations that RasGAP function decreases the Ras/MAP kinase pathway activity and migration (Kundra et al.	[[94, 104]]	[]	['MAP kinase']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1164	The mutant mice not only uncover the role of RTK signal transduction in vivo, but they also reveal some interesting information regarding v/p cell development.	[[45, 48], [138, 141]]	[]	['RTK', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1165	For example, although v/p cell development is impaired when PDGFRβ signal transduction is disrupted, a basal level of cells forms, in agreement with previous observations that propagation, not initiation, of v/p cell development is directed by the PDGFRβ (Lindahl et al.	[[22, 25], [208, 211]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1166	Even in the null embryos, v/p cells can be found.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1167	It has been proposed that PDGFRβ signals are required for the expansion of v/p cells (Lindahl et al.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1168	There are two explanations for the observation that v/p cells never reach wild-type levels.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1169	The first is that there is constant turnover in the v/p population and that the rate of replacement in the mutant mice is below the rate of loss, resulting in a net reduction in the v/p population.	[[52, 55], [182, 185]]	[]	['v/p', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1170	The second possibility is that there is a specific window during development when v/p cells can expand.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1171	After a specified time, v/p cell number expansion could be limited, perhaps related to the ability of endothelial cells to secrete the PDGF ligand (Benjamin et al.	[[135, 139], [24, 27]]	[]	['PDGF', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1172	Support for this model is the inability of nascent endothelial tubes to recruit v/p cells in tumors (Abramsson et al.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1173	The inability to develop sufficient numbers of v/p cells also appears to be recapitulated in the eye vasculature, suggesting that the maturation of the vessel is more dependent on the local environment than on the chronological age of the embryo..	[[47, 50]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1174	Our findings demonstrate that the combination of signaling pathways downstream of PDGFRβ determines the total number of v/p cells.	[[120, 123]]	[]	['v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml
1175	Whether these results are unique to PDGFRβ signal transduction in v/p cells or whether they can be extrapolated to other RTK remains to be demonstrated..	[[121, 124], [66, 69]]	[]	['RTK', 'v/p']	[]	PMC261889.nxml

1185	Recent studies in the yeast mating pathway have shown that inactivation of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS proteins) can induce constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways even in the absence of receptor expression (Siekhaus and Drubin 2003).

1186	Ligand-independent signaling by the pre-T and pre-B cell antigen receptors (pre-TCR and pre-BCR, respectively) promotes the developmental progression of immature cells (Irving et al.	[[92, 95], [80, 83]]	[]	['BCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1187	However, unique cellular compartmentalization of the receptor does not seem to explain the requirement for cell surface expression of the mature BCR for B cell survival, as observed in a hapten-specific receptor system (Lam et al.	[[145, 148]]	[]	['BCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1188	1997).This suggests that basal signaling tone by the unligated BCR that can interact, perhaps by chance, with cellular machinery may be sufficient to send signals downstream that are required for B cells' survival.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['BCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1196	A pivotal role for LAT in TCR signaling was demonstrated in studies using Jurkat T cells deficient in LAT, which display severely impaired PLCγ1 phosphorylation, calcium influx, and MAP kinase (MAPK) activation, as well as impaired activation of transcription factors AP-1, NFAT, and NF-κB upon TCR engagement (Finco et al.	[[268, 272], [19, 22], [102, 105], [194, 198], [274, 278], [139, 144], [26, 29], [295, 298]]	[]	['AP-1', 'LAT', 'LAT', 'MAPK', 'NFAT', 'PLCγ1', 'TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1198	These results point to a requirement for the LAT/SLP-76 module to transmit a signal(s) initiated by engagement of the TCR to the downstream calcium and MAPK pathways..	[[152, 156], [49, 55], [118, 121]]	[]	['MAPK', 'SLP-76', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1199	The thymic developmental blocks observed in mice deficient in LAT or SLP-76 highlight the physiologic importance of the signaling events mediated by these proteins (Clements et al.	[[62, 65], [69, 75]]	[]	['LAT', 'SLP-76']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1200	Mice rendered deficient in these proteins display an early block in thymocyte development at the CD44−CD25+ double-negative (DN) (CD4− and CD8−) stage due to a defect in ligand-independent pre-TCR signaling (see below).	[[125, 127], [193, 196]]	[]	['DN', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1201	Similarly, thymocytes of mice lacking Rag-1 or Rag-2 are arrested at the same stage, thus linking the genes responsible for recombination and subsequent expression of the TCR with the downstream signaling pathways (Mombaerts et al.	[[171, 174]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1202	Rag gene expression can first be detected when DN thymocytes become positive for CD25 and start to rearrange the TCRβ locus.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['DN']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1203	Successful β rearrangement results in surface expression of the pre-TCR, made up of the β chain heterodimerized with a surrogate for the α chain (pre-Tα) and complexed with the signal transducing CD3 and ζ chains.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1204	Low-level surface expression of the pre-TCR by itself can signal independently of the extracellular portions of the TCRβ and pre-Tα chains leading to increased activities of downstream signaling pathways (Irving et al.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1205	Perhaps this reflects the unique localization of the pre-TCR receptor to GEMs (Aifantis et al.	[[73, 76], [57, 60]]	[]	['GEM', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1206	2002), although other studies suggest that GEM localization may not be a unique property of the pre-TCR compared to the αβTCR on thymocytes (Haks et al.	[[43, 46], [100, 103], [122, 125]]	[]	['GEM', 'TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1207	For the thymocyte, this results in increased survival, proliferation, progression to the double-postive (DP) (CD4+ and CD8+) stage, and TCRβ allelic exclusion.	[[105, 107]]	[]	['DP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1209	In contrast to pre-TCR β-chain selection in DN thymocytes, Rag expression and rearrangement in DP cells are only terminated after appropriate ligation of the TCR during positive selection by self-peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Nagaoka et al.	[[44, 46], [95, 97], [242, 245], [19, 22], [158, 161]]	[[208, 240]]	['DN', 'DP', 'MHC', 'TCR', 'TCR']	['major histocompatibility complex']	PMC261890.nxml

1211	DN thymocytes of these mice required 10 kb of genomic sequence 5′ of Rag-2 essential for normal expression of both Rag-1 and Rag-2, whereas DP cells needed an 110 kb region upstream of Rag-2 for both genes.	[[140, 142]]	[]	['DP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1212	Instead, it suggests a requirement for transient repression by uncharacterized signaling pathways until Rag gene expression is no longer needed and the genes can be heritably silenced, accompanied by locus translocation to centromeric DNA, as has been described for SP thymocytes (Brown et al.	[[266, 268]]	[]	['SP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1213	Basal signaling events in DN and DP thymocytes could contribute to the differentiated state of the thymocyte and to the regulation of Rag gene expression.	[[26, 28], [33, 35]]	[]	['DN', 'DP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1214	The exact nature of basal signaling in thymocytes is unknown, but it is probably mechanistically similar to that which is regulated by the pre-TCR and mature TCR.	[[143, 146]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1215	We first analyzed the basal signaling pathway that is downstream of the TCR using the Jurkat T cell line and TCR signaling pathway mutant clones, which were derived from wild-type Jurkat cells.	[[72, 75], [109, 112]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1216	Our identification of RAG genes as targets of a basal signaling pathway defective in some Jurkat mutants led us to explore the potential function of this pathway in regulating RAG gene expression in Jurkat cells and in thymocytes, by using chemical inhibitors to block basal signaling.	[[22, 25], [176, 179]]	[]	['RAG', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1217	We found that, in both Jurkat cells and in thymocytes, constitutive signaling represses expression of a group of genes that includes the RAG genes.	[[137, 140]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1218	Normal RAG gene expression depends on the adapter protein LAT, which transduces a signal to two pathways that induce low-level kinase activity of Erk and Abl..	[[154, 157], [146, 149], [58, 61], [7, 10]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1219	The Jurkat T cell leukemic line E6–1 expresses high levels of mature TCR and low levels of CD4, but no CD8 or MHC class II.	[[110, 113], [69, 72]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1220	In this cell line, phospho-TCRζ can be trapped and upregulated in resting cells that overexpress the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 in the absence of TCR stimulation (Qian et al.	[[108, 111], [148, 151], [123, 129]]	[]	['SH2', 'TCR', 'ZAP-70']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1221	The tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 presumably compete with endogenous phosphatases that oppose the action of Lck and dephosphorylate TCRζ under basal conditions.	[[107, 110], [11, 14], [26, 32]]	[]	['Lck', 'SH2', 'ZAP-70']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1222	We employed a panel of Jurkat T cell mutants lacking specific TCR signaling proteins to study the transcriptional consequences of this constitutive signaling pathway, with the notion that the loss of key components, even in unstimulated cells, might have consequences on the expression of a set of genes.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1223	Using DNA microarrays, we compared gene expression profiles of Jurkat-derived T cell lines deficient for Lck (J.CaM1) (Straus and Weiss 1992), LAT (J.CaM2) (Finco et al.	[[143, 146], [105, 108]]	[]	['LAT', 'Lck']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1233	We reasoned that the effects of disrupting a low-level, basal signal would be most evident in a cell line with an absolute block in TCR signaling and thus initially focused on J.CaM2.	[[132, 135]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1234	Signaling events like calcium mobilization or activation of MAPKs are severely impaired in LAT-deficient J.CaM2 even when the TCR is heavily cross-linked (Finco et al.	[[91, 94], [60, 64], [126, 129]]	[]	['LAT', 'MAPK', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1235	We validated these observations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and noticed that the expression levels of other cell surface markers like CD2, CD5, and CD7 were also reduced.	[[72, 76]]	[[35, 70]]	['FACS']	['fluorescence-activated cell sorting']	PMC261890.nxml
1236	Stable reconstitution of J.CaM2 with LAT cDNA (J.CaM2-LAT) (Finco et al.	[[37, 40], [54, 57]]	[]	['LAT', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1238	Expression levels of two nuclear proteins, TCF7 (Tcf-1) and BIN2, were also reduced in J.CaM2, but again not restored in J.CaM2-LAT, as evidenced by Northern blotting (data not shown).	[[128, 131]]	[]	['LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1239	We concluded that the reduced expression levels of these genes could not be explained by a lack of LAT expression.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1240	LAT-deficient cells also displayed a distinct cluster of genes, including RAG-1 and RAG-2, expressed at higher levels than wild-type Jurkat (left three columns in red in Figure 1B).	[[74, 77], [84, 87]]	[]	['RAG', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1241	These findings were shared with SLP-76-deficient cells (Figure 1A).	[[32, 38]]	[]	['SLP-76']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1242	The elevated expression levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 particularly interested us since it has been well established that induction of the TCR signaling pathway is able to terminate Rag gene expression (Nagaoka et al.	[[34, 37], [44, 47], [134, 137]]	[]	['RAG', 'RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1243	We hypothesized that normal RAG gene expression in resting cells is held in check by a basal signal that requires both LAT and SLP-76..	[[119, 122], [28, 31], [127, 133]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG', 'SLP-76']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1244	To test this hypothesis and to confirm the results obtained in the DNA microarray experiments, we isolated RNA from several cell lines and determined RAG-1 expression levels by Northern blot analysis.	[[150, 153]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1245	Wild-type Jurkat T cells express very low but detectable levels of RAG-1 mRNA (Figure 1C, lane 4).	[[67, 70]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1246	The RAG locus is thus accessible to transcription factors, making this cell line a fortuitous model for our experiments.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1247	The reduced effect of missing SLP-76 in J14 cells on RAG expression could reflect the leaky TCR-signaling phenotype of this mutant (Yablonski et al.	[[53, 56], [30, 36], [92, 95]]	[]	['RAG', 'SLP-76', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1248	Importantly, expression levels were reduced in both mutant cell lines when the repective mutations were complemented with cDNAs encoding full-length LAT (J.CaM2-LAT) (Finco et al.	[[149, 152], [161, 164]]	[]	['LAT', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1250	The elevated RAG-1 expression in the mutants was therefore not an aberrant characteristic caused by accidental mutations at other loci, but rather a result of the deficiency of the adapters LAT or SLP-76.	[[190, 193], [13, 16]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1251	As on the microarray, RAG-1 expression levels analyzed by Northern blot analysis were not increased in J.CaM1 (data not shown).	[[22, 25]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1252	Despite the Lck deficiency, J.CaM1-deficient cells flux calcium when the TCR is heavily cross-linked or in response to anti-CD3 antibodies (Straus and Weiss 1992).	[[12, 15], [73, 76]]	[]	['Lck', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1253	Expression of Fyn in these cells is a likely explanation for this signal.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['Fyn']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1254	In a similar fashion, a low signal may be capable to control RAG-1 expression in J.CaM2 cells..	[[61, 64]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1255	We also made use of mutant Jurkat lines to test whether surface αβTCR expression was required for normal RAG-1 expression, as observed in wild-type Jurkat cells.	[[105, 108], [66, 69]]	[]	['RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1257	We repeated previously published FACS analyses and functional experiments on these lines.	[[33, 37]]	[]	['FACS']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1258	The TCRα- and TCRβ-deficient Jurkat lines express very low, if any, CD3ɛ on the surface, but no αβTCR (Weiss and Stobo 1984; data not shown).	[[98, 101]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1259	As a result, these cells do not flux calcium, produce IL-2, or demonstrate NFAT transcriptional activity in response to TCR stimulation (Ohashi et al.	[[75, 79], [120, 123]]	[]	['NFAT', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1260	1985; data not shown).The TCRα- or TCRβ-deficient Jurkat T cells did not display elevated RAG-1 expression levels such as we observed in LAT-deficient cells (Figure 1D).	[[137, 140], [90, 93]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1261	Surface expression of the αβTCR is therefore dispensable for maintenance of normal levels of RAG-1 transcripts.	[[93, 96], [28, 31]]	[]	['RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1262	Importantly, these results imply that the tonic signal regulating RAG gene expression is not generated by (stimulation of) the extracellular portion of the αβTCR, but rather by an intrinsically active signaling pathway.	[[66, 69], [158, 161]]	[]	['RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1265	This process can be mimicked in thymocytes in vitro by cross-linking the TCR, which leads to activation of PLCγ and subsequent generation of the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (Turka et al.

1266	The same effect is obtained when DAG and IP3 generation are replaced by stimulation with synthetic analogues phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Turka et al.	[[33, 36], [41, 44], [136, 139]]	[[109, 134]]	['DAG', 'IP3', 'PMA']	['phorbol myristate acetate']	PMC261890.nxml

1272	In contrast, transcripts of TCRα were induced following PMA stimulation of J.CaM2 (Figure 2A), as has been described for wild-type Jurkat T cells (Lindsten et al.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['PMA']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1273	The reduction of RAG-1 levels by PMA stimulation was still observed when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide (Figure 2B).	[[33, 36], [17, 20]]	[]	['PMA', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1274	The cycloheximide and actinomycin D experiments suggest that signals through the PKC/MAPK pathways are able to repress RAG-1 gene transcription in a relatively direct fashion, leading to loss of detectable RAG-1 mRNA.

1275	The fact that RAG-1 expression is elevated in these cells, but can be reduced by a PMA signal, suggests that the LAT/SLP-76 module is essential for a constitutive, suppressive signal that operates, in part, through the downstream signaling pathways.

1285	However, we have previously demonstrated that these phosphorylated tyrosine residues in LAT can be substrates for the phosphatase CD148.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1286	Doxycyclin-inducible expression of CD148 in Jurkat T cells rather selectively inhibits TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1; the latter effect may be secondary to the effect on LAT (Baker et al.

1287	Induction of CD148 expression for 1, 3, or 7 d resulted in increasingly high RAG-1 levels, suggesting that basal phosphorylation of LAT in unstimulated cells is crucial for proper RAG-1 expression (Figure 3B).	[[132, 135], [77, 80], [180, 183]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1296	By contrast, reconstitution with a signaling-defective LAT molecule without tyrosine residues, and thus without docking sites for other signaling proteins, did not result in a reduction of RAG gene expression (Figure 3Cd).	[[55, 58], [189, 192]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1297	Reconstitution with a LAT molecule that does not get palmitoylated resulted only in partial reduction, suggesting that there is a partial, constitutive signal generated by LAT molecules independent of GEM localization (Figure 3Ce).

1302	Treatment of unstimulated Jurkat cells with PP2 increased expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 to a level similar to that in J.CaM2 cells, suggesting that basal Lck and/or Fyn kinase activity is required for constitutive repression of these genes (Figure 3Ch)..

1315	The effects of the inhibitors shown were specific since no change in RAG-1 expression was observed when Jurkat cells were treated with inhibitors specific for protein kinase A (PKA) (H89) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (rapamycin) (data not shown)..

1320	Jurkat T cells are deficient for the phosphatases PTEN (3′-phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and SHIP (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5′-phosphatase) (Astoul et al.

1321	As a result, there is more active inositol phospholipid signaling in Jurkat T cells, and PI3K inhibitors elicit little effect.	[[89, 93]]	[]	['PI3K']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1322	Induction of PTEN expression using a doxycyclin-inducible expression system (Xu et al.	[[13, 17]]	[]	['PTEN']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1323	2002) produced no appreciable change in basal RAG-1 expression.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1324	Subsequent treatment of the PTEN-expressing cell with LY294002, however, led to a level of induction of RAG-1 expression similar to that observed with the other inhibitors (Figure 4B).	[[28, 32], [104, 107]]	[]	['PTEN', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1325	This would suggest that the high basal level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in Jurkat cells is not responsible for RAG-1 gene repression and that the LY294002 could not modulate the levels of PIP3 in PTEN-deficient Jurkat cells, consistent with our previous findings (Kane et al.

1326	The effects of selective inhibitors, together with the results of our previous experiments with mutant cell lines, point to a tonic signaling pathway that closely resembles a TCR-inducible pathway, with Src family kinase activity as the most upstream component and MAPK as the most downstream component regulating RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression in Jurkat cells (for a model, see Figure 8).

1333	The effects of basal phosphorylation of LAT are twofold: (1) recruitment and activation of PLCγ generates low levels of second messengers that signal through calcium and Ras pathways, culminating in Erk kinase activity; and (2) phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 6 of LAT, likely establishing a LAT–PLCγ–Abl complex, is required for low-level kinase activity of Abl.

1360	Indeed, inhibition of Abl kinase activity by STI-571 in Jurkat T cells induced RAG-1 expression to a level similar to that induced by the inhibitors PP2 and Ro-318220 (Figure 5A).	[[22, 25], [79, 82]]	[]	['Abl', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1372	To our surprise, treatment with STI-571 only slightly decreased phospho-Erk (Figure 5E, lane 8), raising the possibility that Abl and Erk kinases may act in separate, basally active pathways to repress RAG-1 expression..

1373	To resolve this question, we analyzed these low-level, constitutive phospho-c-Abl and phospho-Erk signals by intracellular FACS staining (we were unable to use the site-specific phospho-Y245 for c-Abl in Western blot analysis; data not shown).

1374	PMA stimulation of Jurkat T cells for 10 min resulted in 6-fold induction of phospho-Erk signal compared to unstimulated Jurkat (arbitrarily set at 100 in the accompanying bar graph of Figure 6A, panel I).	[[85, 88]]	[]	['Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1375	As shown in the same panel, 24-h administration of a MEK-1 and MEK-2 inhibitor (U-0126) effectively blunted the phospho-Erk response, whereas the c-Abl inhibitor had a detectable but consistently smaller effect.

1376	The STI-571 inhibitor was, however, very potent in blocking the phospho-Abl signal in K562 cells, which reflects the kinase activity of BCR–Abl in this cell line (Figure 6A, panel II).	[[72, 75], [140, 143]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1377	Similar to the basal activity of the Erk kinases (Figure 6A, panel IV), phosphorylation of tyrosine 245 in Abl was consistently reduced in unstimulated J.CaM2 cells, resulting in a fluorescence signal not significantly above isotype control (Figure 6A, panels V and VI).

1378	The phospho-Abl signal observed in Jurkat T cells probably reflects both phosphorylated c-Abl and phosphorylated Arg since the two kinases are highly conserved in the tyrosine 245 region.	[[12, 15], [90, 93]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1379	Importantly, phospho-Abl levels were restored in the J.CaM2-LAT line, pointing to an essential role for LAT in Abl phosphorylation (Figure 6A, panel V; Figure 6B).	[[21, 24], [111, 114], [60, 63], [104, 107]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'LAT', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1386	The signals that elicit Abl phosphorylation were limited to Src and Abl kinases since blockade of PLCγ, MEK-1 and MEK-2, or calcineurin activity had no effect on the phosphorylation status of tyrosine 245 (Figure 6C).

1387	PP2 and STI-571 reduced the phospho-Abl level to that observed in J.CaM2, virtually equal to isotype control staining.	[[36, 39]]	[]	['Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1388	It should be noted that PP2 has recently been reported to inhibit to some extent c-Kit and BCR–Abl (Tatton et al.	[[95, 98]]	[]	['Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1389	Therefore, the PP2 effect may be the combined result of blocking Src family kinases and direct inhibition of Abl kinases.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1390	Together, these findings suggest that constitutive activity of Abl represses RAG gene expression, requires the presence of LAT, and is blocked by Src and Abl kinase inhibitors, but is unaffected by Erk activity..	[[63, 66], [154, 157], [198, 201], [123, 126], [77, 80]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'Erk', 'LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1391	The unaltered phosphorylation status of Abl in U-0126-treated cells suggested that the MEK–Erk pathway does not contribute to basal Abl activity in our model.	[[40, 43], [132, 135], [91, 94]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1392	To further test this, we elevated the basal MAPK signal in Jurkat T cells by addition of 5 ng/ml PMA for 24 h.	[[44, 48], [97, 100]]	[]	['MAPK', 'PMA']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1393	This treatment induced a higher level of phospho-Erk that is largely abrogated by U-0126, but not by PP2 (left panel of Figure 7A).	[[49, 52]]	[]	['Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1394	By contrast, low amounts of PMA did not induce phosphorylation of Abl kinases (middle panel of Figure 7A).	[[66, 69], [28, 31]]	[]	['Abl', 'PMA']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1395	Therefore, whereas inhibition of Abl has modest effects on Erk phosphorylation, Erk activity does not enhance phosphorylation of tyrosine 245 in Abl.	[[33, 36], [59, 62], [80, 83]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1396	These observations further support the notion that Abl and Erk operate independently to regulate the expression of RAG-1.	[[51, 54], [59, 62], [115, 118]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1397	This notion is illustrated by the additive effects of STI-571 and U-0126 in inducing RAG-1 expression (Figure 7B).	[[85, 88]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1398	Addition of STI-571, U-0126, or a combination of these inhibitors, or even targeting Src family kinases upstream of Abl and Erk, did not result in a hyperinduction of RAG-1 in the J.CaM2 line (Figure 7C)..	[[116, 119], [124, 127], [167, 170]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1405	Finally, the results above demonstrated that the roles of Erk and Abl kinases in controlling RAG-1 gene expression are largely parallel rather than sequential.	[[66, 69], [58, 61], [93, 96]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1406	MAPK activation by TCR stimulation has been known to rely on LAT (Finco et al.	[[61, 64], [19, 22]]	[]	['LAT', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1407	How does LAT transduce a unique signal to Abl? To study a possible LAT–Abl connection, we made use of a panel of J.CaM2 cell lines reconstituted with LAT molecules that carry point mutations of tyrosine residues (see Figure 3A).	[[42, 45], [71, 74], [9, 12], [150, 153]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'LAT', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1408	We and others have previously demonstrated that induction of phospho-Erk upon TCR stimulation is impaired in J.CaM2 lines reconstituted with LATY→F6,7,8 or LATY→F6 (Zhang et al.	[[69, 72], [78, 81]]	[]	['Erk', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1409	These studies demonstrated the importance of PLCγ recruitment to tyrosine 132 (#6) in LAT for TCR-induced calcium flux and Erk activation.	[[123, 126], [86, 89], [94, 97]]	[]	['Erk', 'LAT', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1410	As demonstrated in Figure 7D, constitutive phosphorylation of both Erk and Abl kinases in these two lines was decreased compared to wild-type Jurkat and comparable to the levels seen in J.CaM2-LATallF and J.CaM2 cells.	[[75, 78], [67, 70]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1411	Consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of these two kinases, RAG-1 expression was increased in J.CaM2 cells reconstituted with LAT carrying only a single substitution of tyrosine residue 132 by phenylalanine (Figure 7E).	[[132, 135], [66, 69]]	[]	['LAT', 'RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1412	Thus, Abl, like Erk, depends upon phosphorylation of tyrosine 132 in LAT..	[[6, 9], [16, 19], [69, 72]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1413	Our studies reveal that even without TCR engagement, the signaling pathways normally responsive to TCR stimulation are not inert.	[[37, 40], [99, 102]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1414	The tonic basal signal we characterized in this study maintains repression of RAG gene expression and involves a TCR-like signal transduction pathway.	[[78, 81], [113, 116]]	[]	['RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1415	One arm of the pathway requires Src family kinase activity, presence of LAT–SLP-76, and the enzyme activities of PLCγ1, PKC, PI3K, MEK-1, and calcineurin, culminating in basal kinase activity of Erk (Figure 8).	[[195, 198], [131, 134], [125, 129], [120, 123], [113, 118], [76, 82]]	[]	['Erk', 'MEK', 'PI3K', 'PKC', 'PLCγ1', 'SLP-76']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1416	Proper signal transduction relies on Src family kinase activity and the presence of tyrosine 132 in LAT and can be blocked by STI-571 (Figure 8).	[[100, 103]]	[]	['LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1417	We postulate that these constitutive signals may function to repress RAG gene expression during thymopoiesis and, as such, allow the locus to remain accessible for later usage without inappropriate expression..	[[69, 72]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1418	In order to survive, B cells require surface expression of the BCR that generates a basal signal independently of endogenous antigen (Lam et al.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['BCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1419	2001), although they do depend on either Lck or Fyn as well as CD4 and MHC molecules for survival (Zamoyska et al.	[[48, 51], [41, 44], [71, 74]]	[]	['Fyn', 'Lck', 'MHC']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1420	In this study, we have identified a TCR-independent and MHC-independent signaling pathway that maintains repression of RAG gene expression in a constitutive fashion.	[[56, 59], [119, 122], [36, 39]]	[]	['MHC', 'RAG', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1421	It is perhaps not surprising that in Jurkat cells and in thymocytes this pathway shares components with conventional TCR signaling.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1422	Key effector molecules for this repressive signal are Erk and Abl kinases.	[[62, 65], [54, 57]]	[]	['Abl', 'Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1423	One branch of this constitutive signaling pathway involves Src family kinase activity, presumably phosphorylation of TCRζ and ZAP-70, phosphorylation of LAT, and recruitment and activation of PLCγ (Figure 8).	[[153, 156], [126, 132]]	[]	['LAT', 'ZAP-70']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1424	This results, most likely, through low-level generation of the second messengers IP3 and DAG in constitutive activation of Erk kinases.	[[89, 92], [123, 126], [81, 84]]	[]	['DAG', 'Erk', 'IP3']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1425	We also identified a novel second pathway that results in constitutive phosphorylation and activity of Abl, which requires phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 132 in LAT, but not PLCγ, activation.	[[103, 106], [166, 169]]	[]	['Abl', 'LAT']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1426	The specific requirement of tyrosine residue 132 suggests that this pathway involves the formation of a LAT–PLCγ–Abl or LAT–Abl complex.	[[113, 116], [124, 127]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1427	Recently a complex of c-Abl and PLCγ1 has been reported in growth factor receptor signaling (Plattner et al.	[[24, 27], [32, 37]]	[]	['Abl', 'PLCγ1']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1428	In agreement with these results, we observed a decrease in basal Abl phosphorylation in PLCγ1-deficient Jurkat cells (J.gamma1) and normal Abl phosphorylation in PLCγ1-reconstituted cells (J.gamma1.WT1; data not shown).	[[65, 68], [139, 142], [88, 93], [162, 167]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'PLCγ1', 'PLCγ1']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1429	However, basal activity of Erk kinases in this mutant cell line was hardly affected, possibly because of compensation by PLCγ2 in this cell line.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['Erk']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1430	As a result RAG-1 expression was only moderately increased, yet it was still repressed in J.gamma1.WT1 (data not shown).	[[12, 15]]	[]	['RAG']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1431	Together these results imply an unappreciated role for Abl kinases in thymopoiesis and TCR signaling.	[[55, 58], [87, 90]]	[]	['Abl', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1432	c-Abl-deficient mice are born runted, are less viable, and show signs of lymphopenia, but no stage-specific block in lymphocyte development (Schwartzberg et al.	[[2, 5]]	[]	['Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1433	Various mechanisms initiating c-Abl activation have been suggested, such as displacement of the myristate group or the SH2 or SH3 domain, all disrupting the inactive conformation and allowing tyrosine phosphorylation of residue 245 in the linker region or of 412 in the activation loop (Hantschel et al.

1434	We hypothesize that in this signaling pathway, binding of Abl to PLCγ opens up the inactive conformation.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1435	In addition, formation of a LAT–PLCγ–Abl complex could bring Abl in close proximity to Src family kinases, facilitating phosphorylation of Abl by Src..	[[37, 40], [61, 64], [139, 142]]	[]	['Abl', 'Abl', 'Abl']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1438	Interestingly, these peripheral cells and DP and SP thymocytes display dramatically reduced surface TCR levels in comparison to their wild-type counterparts.	[[42, 44], [49, 51], [100, 103]]	[]	['DP', 'SP', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1439	Alternatively, our data suggest that these thymocytes may aberrantly express Rag genes, resulting in undesirable further rearrangement leading to self-reacting TCRs..	[[160, 163]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1441	When ex vivo DP thymocytes are stimulated overnight with anti-TCR antibody, half of the cells have inactivated the Rag locus by repositioning to centromeric regions (Brown et al.	[[13, 15], [62, 65]]	[]	['DP', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1442	Incubation of these DP cells with stroma results in the development into SP thymocytes combined with complete centromeric repositioning of the Rag locus.	[[20, 22], [73, 75]]	[]	['DP', 'SP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1444	In addition, repression may ensure physiologic Rag levels, allowing the DP thymocyte to test the newly assembled αβTCR before additional TCRα rearrangements are started.	[[72, 74], [115, 118]]	[]	['DP', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1445	Total thymocyte populations, as analyzed in Figure 4C, typically contain 80% DP cells.	[[77, 79]]	[]	['DP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1446	Given the effects we observe with the various inhibitors on total thymocytes with DP thymocytes being by far the largest population, this is the most likely subset where basal repression of Rag expression takes place..	[[82, 84]]	[]	['DP']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1447	Nevertheless, many components that transduce this repressive signal are expressed in thymocytes well before TCR or pre-TCR signaling occurs.	[[108, 111], [119, 122]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC261890.nxml
1448	It is therefore possible that Rag genes are repressed even before the first wave of Rag expression occurrs in CD25-positive DN thymocytes.	[[124, 126]]	[]	['DN']	[]	PMC261890.nxml

1685	Mice were followed throughout their lives according to the following experimental scheme: (i) all cohorts were subjected to serial monthly (in selected cases, biweekly) nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see Materials and Methods) for detection of morphological changes in the size and shape of the prostate; (ii) mice were sacrificed at or prior to tumor detection for postmortem pathological analysis or when manifest sign of distress were observed (owing to tumor codevelopment; Ptenhy/− mutants, as Pten+/− mice, in fact, developed tumors of multiple histologic origins; data not shown).

1687	Pten+/− mutants developed moderate/low-grade PINs at incomplete penetrance (35%–40% approximately, after a long latency of >12 mo) that were only detected by serial postmortem analysis, as previously reported (Figure 2F; Di Cristofano et al.	[[45, 48]]	[]	['PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml

1697	The Neo cassette was excised from the locus in vivo by intercrossing Ptenhy/+ with EIIA-Cre transgenic mice (Lakso et al.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['Neo']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1698	In these mice, the Cre recombinase is expressed transiently, early in embryogenesis, allowing the production of a mosaic progeny that harbors in the germline Pten alleles in three different configurations: targeted unmodified (still retaining the Neo cassette), Pten floxed, or Pten deleted (Figure 3A).

1699	To this end, we made use of two different Cre transgenic lines, PB-Cre and PB-Cre4, in which the Cre gene is under the control of two distinct versions of the rat Probasin (PB) gene promoter (Maddison et al.	[[64, 66], [75, 77], [173, 175]]	[]	['PB', 'PB', 'PB']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1700	The PB gene is expressed in the prostatic epithelium postpuberty since the gene is androgen responsive (Matusik et al.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['PB']	[]	PMC270016.nxml

1712	In Ptenpc1 mutants, the enlargement was less pronounced at early stages and undetectable by MRI, but still apparent (see Figure 4B; Figure 5D).	[[92, 95]]	[]	['MRI']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1713	Even more strikingly, however, pathological analysis of prostates from Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mice revealed in both mutants, at complete penetrance, the development of invasive and diffuse CaP after a variable latency (see Figure 4B; Figure 5E).	[[186, 189]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1714	Although the tumors were clearly invasive in both Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mutants with disruption of the basement membrane and clear signs of organ infiltration, once again we observed differences in the CaPs from these two models.	[[200, 203]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1715	Thus, Pten conditional inactivation in the prostate leads to invasive and diffuse CaP at complete penetrance..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1716	By contrast, MEFs of all genotypes from the hypomorphic series did not show noticeable differences in their growth rates under standard culture conditions, while showing progressive activation of the Akt signaling pathway (data not shown; see Figure 1C).

1717	We next assessed whether and how the progressive reduction of the Pten dose would affect the functions of key downstream targets such as Akt, p27Kip1, mTOR, and FOXO3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot (WB) analysis (see Materials and Methods).

1718	Staining of prostates from various genotypes with this antibody increased proportionally to the decrease in Pten levels as confirmed by WB analysis (see Figures 2B, 5B, and 5C; data not shown).	[[136, 138]]	[]	['WB']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1719	In addition, IHC analysis revealed a drastically different staining pattern in prostate cells from Ptenpc2 mutants when compared with cells from other genotypes in that phospho-Akt was found to overtly accumulate at the plasma membrane (Figure 5C).	[[13, 16]]	[]	['IHC']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1720	Ptenhy/− mice develop at complete penetrance high-grade PIN at a young age (8–10 wk) and roughly 25% present invasive CaP around 8 mo.	[[118, 121], [56, 59]]	[]	['CaP', 'PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1721	Ptenpc mice develop invasive CaP at complete penetrance.	[[29, 32]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1722	Possibilities for human therapeutic intervention derived from our findings: in addition to inactivation of PI3K/AKT and mTOR enzymatic activities (in PTEN loss of heterozygosity condition), monitoring and elevation of PTEN expression levels of the remaining allele could not only prevent formation of PIN lesions (in PTEN+/− individuals), but could importantly also be used to counteract the progression to invasive phenotypes (as observed in Ptenhy/−mouse mutants)..	[[301, 304], [150, 154], [218, 222]]	[]	['PIN', 'PTEN', 'PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1723	In this supposedly linear and multistep process, which separates two extremely different anatomical and pathological entities, a normal prostatic epithelium from an invasive CaP, there are, in between, a discrete number of anatomically distinct intermediary steps, such as prostate hyperplasia > displasia/low-grade PIN > high-grade PIN > locally invasive CaP > diffused CaP.	[[174, 177], [356, 359], [316, 319], [333, 336]]	[]	['CaP', 'CaP', 'PIN', 'PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1724	We show in this study that inactivation of one Pten allele in the mouse may lead to prostate epithelial hyperplasia, as complete inactivation of p27Kip1 in the mouse leads to what resembles human benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).	[[225, 228]]	[]	['BPH']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1725	However, these two lesions are very different in nature and outcome: the first, in fact, impacts only on epithelial elements and over time evolves to low-grade PIN, while the second impacts on both epithelial and stroma elements, representing hyperplasia of the whole organ, but does not evolve toward malignancy (Figure 6; Cordon-Cardo et al.	[[160, 163]]	[]	['PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1726	This obviously does not exclude that loss of p27Kip1 expression when accompanied by additional genetic events (e.g., loss of PTEN) may lead to a completely different outcome, as is also supported by our previous in vivo analysis in the mouse (Figure 6; Di Cristofano et al.	[[125, 129]]	[]	['PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1727	Moreover, our data demonstrate that a further reduction in the Pten dose, as observed in the Ptenhy/− mutants, accelerates tumor progression dramatically, eventually resulting in high-grade PIN and locally invasive carcinoma (Figure 6).	[[190, 193]]	[]	['PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1728	As a large number of CaP patients (more than 80%) display at presentation loss of one PTEN allele, but do retain the other normal PTEN allele, it could be proposed that high-grade PIN or locally invasive prostate carcinomas could be prevented or treated by pharmacologically modulating the expression of the remaining PTEN allele or by antagonizing the downstream consequences of PTEN downregulation or partial inactivation (e.g., PI3K/mTOR activation; Figure 6)..	[[21, 24], [180, 183], [86, 90], [130, 134], [318, 322], [380, 384]]	[]	['CaP', 'PIN', 'PTEN', 'PTEN', 'PTEN', 'PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1729	While the massive prostate hyperplasia/dysplasia observed in the Ptenhy/− mutants is not, as expected, accompanied by complete loss of Pten expression (see Figure 2E), the low penetrance of the invasive CaP in these mutants strongly suggest that additional events have to occur for this pathological transition to occur.	[[203, 206]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1730	Nevertheless, it is important to underscore that Pten+/− mice, unlike Ptenhy/− mutants, do not develop invasive CaP, but only low-grade PIN lesions (Figure 6).	[[112, 115], [136, 139]]	[]	['CaP', 'PIN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1731	In agreement with this notion, MEFs from Ptenhy/− mutants do not display proliferative advantage in standard culture condition over wild-type MEFs.	[[31, 34], [142, 145]]	[]	['MEF', 'MEF']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1732	This information should be factored in when tailoring the treatment of CaP or high-grade PIN lesions that have completely lost PTEN function.	[[71, 74], [89, 92], [127, 131]]	[]	['CaP', 'PIN', 'PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1733	These lesions may be extremely sensitive to PI3K or mTOR inhibitors, while modulation of PTEN expression would not be a therapeutic option in these cases (Figure 6).	[[44, 48], [89, 93]]	[]	['PI3K', 'PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1734	On the basis of these findings, it would seem therefore of paramount importance to routinely assess the status of the PTEN gene and its expression in human CaPs and precancerous lesions as a key biomarker to opt for the most appropriate therapeutic or chemopreventive intervention modalities.	[[156, 159], [118, 122]]	[]	['CaP', 'PTEN']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1735	It remains to be seen whether complete Pten inactivation in the mouse prostate also influences the metastatic potential of these invasive CaPs alone or in combination with additional oncogenic events.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1736	In this respect, while MRI and postmortem analyses have indeed revealed the presence of lung neoplastic lesions in our conditional Pten mutants, morphological and molecular analyses have so far excluded the metastatic nature of these tumors (M.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['MRI']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1737	In Pten null epithelial cells, both in the preneoplastic stage or in overt CaPs, phospho-Akt is found to accumulate almost exclusively at the plasma membrane (see Figure 5C).	[[75, 78]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1738	In addition, Pten+/− mice never develop invasive CaP, whereas Ptenhy/− mice do (Figure 6).	[[49, 52]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml
1739	On the one hand, it could be speculated that human CaP likely arises from a single transformed cell and that therefore that the field effects observed in mouse models will not be critical determinants in the natural history of the human disease.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['CaP']	[]	PMC270016.nxml

1939	We observed a first indication for association (or trend) between morbid obesity and four SNPs at position −243 A>G, +84 G>A, 61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A (0.035 < p < 0.1; 1.27 > odds ratio [OR] > 1.02).	[[90, 93]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml

1941	As we cannot exclude an effect of uncommon polymorphisms (prevalence, <5%) in the coding regions on morbid obesity, we genotyped SNPs +2414 C>A (Pro153Gln), +53881 C>T (Thr339Thr), and +70210 A>T in this first cohort.	[[129, 132]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1942	No association between these SNPs and obesity was observed (data not shown)..	[[29, 32]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1943	In order to confirm these results, we genotyped −243 A>G, +84 G>A, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A SNPs in additional sets of 226 unrelated morbidly obese subjects with familial history of obesity and of 270 nonobese normoglycemic subjects selected from 294 families representative of the general population from northern France.	[[94, 97]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1944	In this replication study, a trend for association between the G allele of the −243 A>G SNP and morbid obesity was found (OR = 1.25 [0.906–1.722], p = 0.17).	[[122, 124], [88, 91]]	[]	['OR', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml

1949	Haplotype analyses of SNPs −243 A>G, +84 G>A, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A were then performed by both haplotype trend regression (HTR) and permutation and model-free analysis and estimation haplotype (PM+EH+) methods.

1950	Haplotypes including SNP +84 G>A with each of the three remaining SNPs did not improve association with morbid obesity, and indeed association of SNP +84 G>A resulted from its LD with the other three SNPs (data not shown).

1952	Haplotype structures, including the three SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A, were then investigated in the 575 unrelated morbidly obese patients with familial history of obesity and in the 646 nonobese subjects.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1953	Among the eight possible haplotypes defined by SNPs −243, +61450, and +83897, only six haplotypes displayed a frequency of greater than 1% and their combined prevalence encompassed all but 2% of the haplotypes seen in the population (Table 3)..	[[47, 50]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1954	Haplotypes covering three (−243 , +61450, +83897) and two (+61450, +83897) SNPs have been investigated.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1955	Comparison of haplotype frequencies performed by HTR between cases and controls showed evidence for association with obesity with an empirical p value of 0.0004.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['HTR']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1956	It is noteworthy that the risk G allele at SNP −243 A>G was present on several haplotypes with frequencies lower than 1% that cannot be taken into account for the haplotype analysis.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1957	SNPs −243, +61450, and +83897 were in strong LD, and the χ2 between these markers ranged from 556 to 1265; thus, p values were <0.00001.	[[45, 47]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1958	In addition, posterior probabilities of haplotype accuracy, as assayed by software for estimating frequencies of large haplotypes of SNPs, SNPHAP, were greater than 0.98 for 98% of the subjects included in the study.	[[133, 136], [139, 145]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNPHAP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1959	Moreover, on a background wild-type CC for SNP +61450 C>A or TT for SNP +83897 T>A, association of SNP −243 A>G with morbid obesity remained significant (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively).	[[43, 46], [68, 71], [99, 102]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1960	The independent effect of −243 A>G was confirmed by haplotype analysis of SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A that presented a significant association with morbid obesity, overall permutation showing an empirical p < 0.0001.	[[74, 77]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1961	Thus, the C–T haplotype displayed a “protective” effect against obesity (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.681–0.972])..	[[88, 90], [73, 75]]	[]	['CI', 'OR']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1962	First, as expected in a region of linkage, the SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A showed significant linkage with a binary obese status, displaying an MLS of, respectively, 2.54, 1.86, and 4.54 (data not shown).	[[158, 161], [47, 50]]	[]	['MLS', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1963	The SNPs of GAD certainly show linkage with obesity and that they are, therefore, worth investigating for familial-based association tests (FBATs)..	[[140, 144], [12, 15], [4, 7]]	[[106, 137]]	['FBAT', 'GAD', 'SNP']	['familial-based association test']	PMC270019.nxml
1964	The FBAT was used to detect association in our established linkage context.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['FBAT']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1965	In single SNP analyses, we observed an association and an excess of wild-type alleles in nonaffected offspring for SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A (Z = −2.17, p = 0.03 and Z = −2.09, p = 0.03, respectively) and a trend toward association and excess of G allele for SNP −243 A>G in affected offspring (Z = 1.87, p = 0.06).	[[10, 13], [115, 118], [264, 267]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1966	For haplotype analysis of SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A, the global test for association with obesity was significant (χ2 = 7.637, p = 0.02).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1967	A significant association with the evidence of linkage was observed for SNP +61450 C>A.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1968	Seventeen nuclear families, with concordant affected sibpairs for the A–A genotype, displayed a LOD score of 4.13, p = 0.02 (as this LOD score was reached 20 times out of 1,000 simulations, assessing a C allele frequency of 0.72, the value in the control cohorts).	[[96, 99], [133, 136]]	[]	['LOD', 'LOD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1969	Remaining sibpairs nonconcordant for this genotype displayed a LOD score of 1.75.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['LOD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1970	Thus, it is impossible to exclude that SNP +61450 C>A explains the observed linkage..	[[39, 42]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1971	To confirm that the GAD2 gene itself is responsible for the observed LD with obesity around the D10S197 marker, pairwise LD among SNPs in the region was investigated and graphically represented using the GOLD software (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/asthma/gold).

1972	Various studies reported that LD extends between 10 and 30 kb for common alleles (Ardlie et al.	[[30, 32]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1973	Then, LD analysis was performed in a 300 kb region including the GAD2 gene and its only known nearby gene MYO3A, located 4.14 kb downstream the GAD2 gene.	[[6, 8]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1974	LD analysis of 28 SNPs covering the 300 kb region including GAD2 and MYO3A genes showed that they belong to distinct blocks of LD (Figure 2).	[[127, 129], [18, 21]]	[]	['LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1975	SNPs in the MYO3A gene were not in LD with those of the GAD2 gene.	[[35, 37]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1976	Moreover, none of the MYO3A SNPs was associated with obesity or related phenotypes (data not shown), suggesting that the observed association with morbid obesity is likely to be due to the GAD2 gene itself..	[[28, 31]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1977	Pairwise LD between SNPs is measured by triangles (color scale).	[[9, 11], [20, 23]]	[]	['LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1978	Regions of high and low LD are represented by red and blue shading, respectively.	[[24, 26]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1979	The graph is not to scale; indeed, the SNPs are equidistant to highlight the detailed pattern of LD..	[[97, 99], [39, 42]]	[]	['LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1980	The −243 A>G SNP displayed the highest level of association with massive obesity and is located in the 5′ flanking region.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1981	As the −243 A>G was in strong LD with two promoter SNPs, −1600 G>A (D′ = 0.991), and −2004 A>T (D′ = 0.996) SNPs, we investigated the potential effect of the three individual SNPs on GAD2 transcription.

1982	G, A, and T alleles at −243 A>G, −1600 G>A, and −2004 A>T SNPs were generated into the wild-type construct (wt).	[[58, 61]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1983	To examine the effects of the −243 >G SNP on binding affinity and specificity for transcription, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using nuclear extracts from βTC3 cells and two pairs of DNA oligonucleotide probes that differed only by the SNP.

1984	βTC3 nuclear proteins have an higher affinity for the G allele variant than for the A allele at SNP −243 A>G..	[[96, 99]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1985	To further explore the contribution of the GAD2 gene and especially of its functional polymorphism, −243 A>G SNP, in the modulation of food intake, we analyzed data obtained through the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Stunkard and Messick 1985) in the morbidly obese population.	[[109, 112], [221, 225]]	[]	['SNP', 'TFEQ']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1986	In morbidly obese subjects, SNP −243 A>G was associated with scores of the TFEQ.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1987	SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A were also evaluated for these scores, but only SNP +83897 T>A showed significant association with the hunger score (p = 0.04).	[[78, 81]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1988	Association with eating parameters and haplotype including SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A did not reach significance..	[[59, 62]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1989	The three stable factors—cognitive restraint of eating, disinibition, and hunger—were assessed in 464 morbidly obese patients to fill in the TFEQ established by Stunkard and Messick (1985).	[[141, 145]]	[]	['TFEQ']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1990	Haplotype including the wild-type alleles (A–C–T) for SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A was associated with a lower hunger score than haplotype including variant alleles (G–A–A) (p = 0.01 by HTR).	[[199, 202], [54, 57]]	[]	['HTR', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1991	A similar nonsignificant trend was observed for the disinhibition score (p = 0.08 by HTR).	[[85, 88]]	[]	['HTR']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1992	The TFEQ was not available in nonobese subjects..	[[4, 8]]	[]	['TFEQ']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1993	A correlation between GAD65 autoantibody (GAD65Ab) levels and high BMI previously reported in a Swedish population was assumed to be related with the obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia that stimulates the generation of GAD65Ab (Rolandsson et al.	[[67, 70]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1994	In order to confirm that GAD2 SNPs may indirectly modulate insulin secretion, thus interacting with food intake regulation, we investigated their potential effect on GAD65Ab level.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1995	As the distribution of GAD65Ab indexes was not normally distributed, we considered natural logarithm (Ln) GAD65Ab values for further analyses.	[[102, 104]]	[[83, 100]]	['Ln']	['natural logarithm']	PMC270019.nxml
1996	As hyperinsulinemia is a characteristic of obese patients, mean values of Ln GAD65Ab indexes were higher in the 575 unrelated morbidly obese patients (3.81 ± 0.35) compared to the 376 nonobese normoglycemic subjects (3.71 ± 0.36; p = 0.007 for the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), in agreement with previous findings (Rolandsson et al.	[[74, 76]]	[]	['Ln']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1997	In the control group, SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A were associated with Ln GAD65Ab adjusted for age and BMI (Figure 6).	[[117, 120], [85, 87], [22, 25]]	[]	['BMI', 'Ln', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1998	Homozygote variant genotypes (GG, AA, AA for SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A) showed lower GAD65Ab levels (p values for the Kruskal–Wallis test: 0.003, 0.047, and 0.006 for SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A, respectively) (Figure 6A).	[[45, 48], [183, 186]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
1999	A similar nonsignificant trend for association between GAD2 SNPs and GAD65Ab indexes was observed in the morbidly obese group (Figure 6B).	[[60, 63]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2000	Thus, promoter GAD2 SNPs associated with obesity were associated with lower levels of antibodies in normal weighted subjects, whereas the elevated GAD65Ab levels of obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia in morbidly obese patients should mask this link..	[[20, 23]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2001	As GABA release from β cells was suggested to strongly inhibit insulin secretion (Shi et al.	[[3, 7]]	[]	['GABA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2002	2000), we looked in nondiabetic control subjects for a potential effect of GAD2 SNPs on fasting insulin and on the β-cell function assessed with the homeostasis model (HOMA-B%).	[[168, 172], [80, 83]]	[]	['HOMA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2003	We found that subjects homozygous (AA) for +83897 T>A showed lower fasting insulin levels and HOMA -B indexes (p values for Kruskal–Wallis test: 0.0091 and 0.01, respectively, for fasting insulin and HOMA-B) (Figure 7), suggesting a deleterious effect of GAD2 SNPs on insulin secretion, probably through an increase of the GABA pool in pancreatic β cells mediated by GAD65 higher enzymatic activity..

2004	Fasting insulin (A) and assessment of HOMA-B% (B) in 376 nonobese normoglycemic subjects according to the genotypes at SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A.	[[38, 42], [119, 122]]	[]	['HOMA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2005	Wild-type are AA, CC, TT; heterozygous are AG, CA, TA; and homozygous are GG, AA, AA, respectively, for each SNP..	[[109, 112]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2006	All together, the identification of a protective effect of the wild-type alleles at SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A supports the hypothesis that the GAD2 gene may modulate the risk of morbid obesity in the French population.	[[84, 87]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2007	Analyses of GAD2 SNP haplotypes allow us to conclude that SNP −243 A>G and an haplotype including SNPs +61450 C>A and +83897 T>A displayed separate effects, as these genetic risk factors have never been encountered on the same haplotype..	[[17, 20], [58, 61], [98, 101]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2008	However, to exclude false-positive association (due to population stratification) and to assess the contribution of GAD2 SNPs to the observed linkage on Chromosome 10p12, we performed studies to examine familial association and association with the evidence of linkage in the nuclear families from the original population showing linkage on this locus.	[[121, 124]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2009	For SNP +61450 C>A, at-risk homozygous-bearing (A–A) affected sibpairs (17 nuclear families) displayed a significant LOD score of 4.13.	[[117, 120], [4, 7]]	[]	['LOD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2010	Remaining affected sibpairs nonconcordant for this genotype displayed alone a LOD score of 1.75 at this locus.	[[78, 81]]	[]	['LOD']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2011	Although this suggests that a unique SNP of the GAD2 gene could explain a significant part of the linkage on Chromosome 10p12 (p = 0.02–0.06), the effect of this SNP, in terms of relative risk, given the prevalence of 1% of morbid obesity and the SNP allelic frequency of 32% in the morbidly obese cohort, is not compatible with such a high MLS.	[[37, 40], [162, 165], [247, 250]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2012	Therefore, it is very likely other SNPs and/or genes located nearby on Chromosome 10p could contribute to the observed linkage..	[[35, 38]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2013	Indeed, the risk G allele at the −243 locus is less frequent than its counterpart at the +61450 locus (0.21 versus 0.32), and if 17 homozygous-bearing (A–A) affected sibpairs were scored for the +61450 SNP, only three homozygous-bearing (G–G) affected sibpairs were scored for the −243 SNP.	[[202, 205]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2014	Thus, an association with obesity and the linkage signal for the −243 SNP, if it exists, may remain undetected.	[[70, 73]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2015	We believe that our case-control data showing association between GAD2 SNPs and morbid obesity do not result from a stratification bias, as there is little allelic heterogeneity in European populations (Ardlie et al.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2016	In this respect, results remained qualitatively similar (but less significant, as the number of subjects was lower) when removing these obese probands from the case-control studies (ORs of 1.28, 95% CI [1.04–1.59], p = 0.02; 1.17, 95% CI [0.97–1.41], p = 0.1; and 1.13, 95% CI [0.91–1.41], p = 0.296, respectively, for SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A)..

2017	On the other hand, the hypothesis of a functional effect for SNP −243 A>G is further supported by transcriptional activity studies, clearly showing that the G allele of SNP −243 A>G increased GAD2 promoter activity although two nearby promoter SNPs (−1600 G>A and −2004 A>T) in strong LD with SNP −243 A>G did not modulate promoter activity.

2018	As suggested by EMSA, a nuclear protein that remains to be identified could have an higher affinity for the G allele.	[[16, 20]]	[]	['EMSA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml

2023	At present, we speculate that an increased activity of the GAD2 gene may increase the GABA pool in the hypothalamus, thus enhancing GABA orexigenic effects, resulting in an altered feeding behavior.	[[86, 90], [132, 136]]	[]	['GABA', 'GABA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml

2025	Investigation in turkeys has demonstrated that intracerebroventricularly injection of varying doses of muscimol, a potent GABA agonist, caused a dose-dependant increase of food intake (Denbow 1991).	[[122, 126]]	[]	['GABA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml

2027	GABA is coexpressed in the subpopulation of NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting that GABA and NPY interact in the paraventricular nucleus to stimulate food intake (Ovesjo et al.	[[96, 100], [44, 47], [105, 108]]	[]	['GABA', 'NPY', 'NPY']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2028	Indeed, the gut-secreted hormone PYY3–36, which potently inhibits food intake in both rodents and in human, acts by inhibiting NPY neurons, thus disinhibiting pro-opiomelanocortinergic (POMC) neurons through a GABA-mediated process (Batterham et al.

2031	It has been speculated that GABA-containing microvesicles are released by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and may have an autocrine/paracrine function within the islet (Gu et al.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['GABA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2032	GABA released from the β cell accordingly inhibits insulin exocytosis by activation of GABA-B receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) and in the α cell suppresses glucagon release by activation of GABA-A receptor Cl channels (Rorsman et al.

2033	Given the anorectic role of insulin and of glucagon-related peptides in the CNS, it is also possible that GAD2 SNP-related increase of the GABA pool in pancreatic islets contributes to modulate food intake (Niswender et al.	[[139, 143], [111, 114]]	[]	['GABA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2034	Indeed, it was recently shown that in a nondiabetic general population from Sweden, the ORs for subjects in the highest BMI group to exceed the 95th or 99th GAD65Ab percentile were 3.6 and 17.6, respectively (Rolandsson et al.	[[120, 123], [88, 90]]	[]	['BMI', 'OR']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2035	In order to have an indirect confirmation of the GAD2 SNP functional role, we then examined possible associations between the SNPs −243 A>G, +61450 C>A, and +83897 T>A and GAD65Ab and plasma insulin levels.	[[54, 57], [126, 129]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2036	These analyses showed lower GAD65Ab levels (especially in the control group) and lower insulin secretion indexes in homozygous variant carriers at any of these SNPs.	[[160, 163]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2037	This is in agreement with a negative regulation by GABA (generated by GAD65 in the β cells) of the first phase of insulin secretion in response to glucose (Shi et al.	[[51, 55]]	[]	['GABA']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2038	The fact that GAD65Ab and related insulin values are lower in GAD2 carriers of SNP variant alleles but are higher in obese compared to normal-weighted subjects may look like a paradox if one wants to see a direct role of GAD65Ab in the development of obesity.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270019.nxml
2039	Instead, GAD65Ab levels should be considered as an intermediary phenotype for GAD2 gene higher expression in subjects carrying the at-risk SNPs that in turn may impair insulin secretion, decrease GAD65Ab secretion, and ultimately influence food intake behavior through insulin central effects..

2080	In conclusion, we find that a region on the short arm of Chromosome 20 contains a gene or genes that appear to be a major risk factor for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, and our evidence supports the view that BMP2 is at least one of these genes..

2081	Genetic analysis of Icelandic families and a replication study in a Danish population provide evidence that variation in the gene BMP2 might contribute to osteoporosis.	[[130, 134]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2082	Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and manifesting clinically with fragility fractures of the hip, spine, and other skeletal sites.	[[76, 79]]	[[54, 74]]	['BMD']	['bone mineral density']	PMC270020.nxml
2083	Various factors may distinguish those who develop osteoporotic fractures from those who do not, but the most important appears to be BMD values, both attained in young adults as well as with increasing age.	[[133, 136]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2084	Firstly, peak bone mass (the highest BMD, attained in young adulthood) may represent an important measure of predisposition to osteoporosis.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2085	There is abundant evidence for a genetic contribution to BMD variation, especially the peak bone mass, but a large genetic contribution to BMD at older ages has also been demonstrated.	[[57, 60], [139, 142]]	[]	['BMD', 'BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2086	Furthermore, the rate of bone loss, bone size and structure, and propensity to fall are all factors with genetic components and all contribute to the risk of osteoporotic fractures beyond BMD itself (Peacock et al.	[[188, 191]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2087	Numerous candidate genes, selected on the basis of current knowledge of bone biology, have been tested for association to BMD and to osteoporotic fractures.	[[122, 125]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2088	A polymorphism in the Sp1 transcription factor-binding site in the first intron of the collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) gene has shown the most consistent association to osteoporosis, although varying between study groups and populations (Efstathiadou et al.	[[101, 107]]	[]	['COL1A1']	[]	PMC270020.nxml

2091	However, instead of simply mapping a quantitative trait locus for BMD itself, we chose to focus on the clinically most relevant manifestation of osteoporosis, low BMD and osteoporotic fractures.	[[66, 69], [163, 166]]	[]	['BMD', 'BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2092	Low BMD is the single best predictor of osteoporotic fractures (Marshall et al.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2093	Furthermore, osteoporotic fractures also occur in individuals who do not fall within low BMD range.	[[89, 92]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2094	Therefore, we defined a novel mixed phenotype for osteoporosis for use in this study, combining low BMD values and osteoporotic fractures themselves.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2095	By combining age-matched BMD values at both the hip and the spine in the same analysis, we attempted to find the underlying genetic basis for generalized osteoporosis, instead of a skeletal site-specific osteoporosis.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2096	Furthermore, although BMD is normally distributed at all ages in the population and is therefore a quantitative trait with presumed polygenic inheritance, it does not necessarily imply that the genes controlling low BMD in families, significant enough to lead to osteoporotic fractures, are the same as those that control the normal distribution of BMD in the population.

2114	We investigated a 6.6 cM region surrounding our linkage peak that corresponds to a 1.7 Mb segment.	[[22, 24]]	[]	['cM']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2115	This region, which includes up to a drop of 1 in LOD score from the linkage peak on the centromeric side and slightly less on the telomeric side, contains six known genes: BMP2, CHGB, LOC51605, C20orf154, C20orf155, and C20orf42 (Figure 2B).	[[172, 176], [49, 52]]	[]	['BMP2', 'LOD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2116	The BMP2 gene is a strong candidate gene, based on its role in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation (Wozney et al.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2117	However, expression analysis showed that four of the genes in the region are expressed in bone marrow or in an osteoblast cell line (BMP2, C20orf42, C20orf154, and CHGB).	[[133, 137]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml

2120	BMP2 was our leading candidate, and we genotyped two microsatellites and 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15 kb region containing BMP2.	[[109, 112]]	[[76, 106]]	['SNP']	['single nucleotide polymorphism']	PMC270020.nxml

2122	In total in the 1.7 Mb region, we genotyped 41 microsatellites, 99 SNPs that are polymorphic in the Icelandic population (some of the public SNPs are exonic), and 20 other SNPs that we identified by screening all exons and flanking intronic sequences of all six genes or expressed sequence tag (EST) matches.

2124	Single-marker association and haplotype analyses showed the strongest association to the region of the BMP2 gene (Figure 3).	[[103, 107]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2125	The BMP2 gene appears to be the only gene within this region, despite our extensive efforts to find additional transcripts (see below).	[[4, 8]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2126	Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis across the region, including some SNPs added subsequently, identified about ten blocks of LD, ranging from 10 kb to 250 kb in size.	[[24, 26], [127, 129], [71, 74]]	[]	['LD', 'LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml

2129	In order to further understand the haplotype associations and to search for functional variations or SNPs that might capture the risk of osteoporosis, we sequenced the BMP2 gene in 188 patients and 94 controls.	[[168, 172], [101, 104]]	[]	['BMP2', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2130	The sequenced region covered the 15 kb containing the BMP2 gene, including all exons, introns, and the promoter region, along with another 44 kb of DNA flanking the gene.	[[54, 58]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2131	We genotyped all patients and controls for 63 SNPs from among those identified within the 59 kb region, including SNPs that we had used in this region in the previous analysis.	[[46, 49], [114, 117]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2132	Three of the SNPs change amino acids in BMP2: Ser37Ala, due to a T to G transversion at nucleotide position 116 in exon 2; Ala94Ser, due to a G to T transversion at nucleotide position 287 in exon 2; and Arg189Ser, due to an A to T transversion at nucleotide position 224 in exon 3.	[[40, 44], [13, 16]]	[]	['BMP2', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2133	It is a relatively rare variant, with allele frequency ranging from 3.0% to 4.9% in patients, depending on the phenotype, versus 0.8% in controls, yielding relative risks (RRs) in the range of 3.8 to 6.3 (Table 2); four of the seven phenotypes tested produce p values smaller than 0.001 after adjusting for the relatedness of the affected (see Materials and Methods).	[[172, 174]]	[[156, 169]]	['RR']	['relative risk']	PMC270020.nxml
2134	Given that Ser37Ala is only one of three missense variants identified in BMP2, we consider this result statistically significant even with adjustment for multiple comparisons..	[[73, 77]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2135	Shown are the BMP2 Ser37Ala missense variant, hapB and hapC, number of affected (#aff) and controls (#ctrl) in the analysis, RR (r), frequency (%) of haplotypes (allelic) in affected and controls, and p values.	[[14, 18], [125, 127]]	[]	['BMP2', 'RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2136	The BMD values are corrected for sex, age, and weight and represent the lowest 10th percentile in all cases.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2137	Premenopausal and postmenopausal phenotypes consist of low BMD values at the hip or the spine.	[[59, 62]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2138	Through our effort to search for these other variants, we found three SNP haplotypes covering the BMP2 gene that show the strongest association to osteoporosis (Table 2; Figure 4A).	[[98, 102], [70, 73]]	[]	['BMP2', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2139	The three haplotypes, hapA, hapB, and hapC, defined by a total of six SNPs, are essentially independent of each other (pairwise R2, less than 0.01).	[[70, 73]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2140	The hapB is defined by three SNPs—TSC0271643 (T), P9313 (T), and rs235764 (G)—and spans from within intron 2 of BMP2 and 263 kb upstream of the gene, going across LD blocks (Figure 4).	[[112, 116], [163, 165], [29, 32]]	[]	['BMP2', 'LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2141	The upstream SNP is in the region of the most significant single-point microsatellite association.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2142	HapC is defined by two SNPs, rs1116867 (A) and D35548 (T), downstream of BMP2 and spans 18 kb (Figure 4).	[[73, 77], [23, 26]]	[]	['BMP2', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2143	HapC is entirely contained within one LD block.	[[38, 40]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2144	There is, however, significant LD between some markers across the hapC LD block and the BMP2 LD block.	[[88, 92], [31, 33], [71, 73], [93, 95]]	[]	['BMP2', 'LD', 'LD', 'LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml

2146	(B) Two measures of LD are shown: D′ values on the upper-left side of the plot and p values on the lower-right side.	[[20, 22]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2147	Scales for the LD strength are provided for both measures to the right.	[[15, 17]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2148	This graph shows uniformly distributed SNPs in a 370 kb region in and around the BMP2 gene.	[[81, 85], [39, 42]]	[]	['BMP2', 'SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2149	The BMP2 block and the next block downstream represent 53 kb..	[[4, 8]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2150	To explore the role of Ser37Ala and hapB and hapC in relation to various forms of osteoporosis, we used several other osteoporotic phenotypes in the association analysis, including osteoporotic fractures, whole-body BMD, and pre- and postmenopausal BMD, each analyzed separately (see Table 2).	[[216, 219], [249, 252]]	[]	['BMD', 'BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2151	The Ser37Ala variant and hapC are associated with all low BMD phenotypes and with osteoporotic fractures.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2152	In fact, the RR for low BMD is higher in premenopausal women than postmenopausal women, indicating that BMP2 may influence the attainment of peak bone mass.	[[24, 27], [104, 108], [13, 15]]	[]	['BMD', 'BMP2', 'RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2153	HapB, on the other hand, seems more associated with osteoporotic fractures than with BMD phenotypes..	[[85, 88]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2154	Removing patients who carry the Ser37Ala variant or the disease-associated haplotypes from the linkage analysis, leaving 152 affected in families informative for linkage, the LOD score drops from 5.10 to 3.55.	[[175, 178]]	[]	['LOD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2155	By performing a randomization test (randomizing the patients and controls) for a procedure that considers all haplotypes within the LD block that contains hapC, the smallest adjusted p value is 0.003 for whole-body BMD (see Table 2), 125 times larger than the unadjusted p value of 2.4 × 10−5.	[[215, 218], [132, 134]]	[]	['BMD', 'LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2156	Since this adjusted p value still has not taken into account the relatedness of the patients, the multiple phenotypes tested, and the other LD blocks in the region, we consider hapC at best marginally significant with the Icelandic data alone.	[[140, 142]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2157	HapB goes across LD blocks, and the randomization procedure is performed by considering all possible haplotypes within the region spanned by those blocks, leading to an even larger adjustment factor.	[[17, 19]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2158	For replication, we used a cohort of Danish postmenopausal women with persistently low BMD and a group of Danish postmenopausal osteoporotic fracture patients.	[[87, 90]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2159	We only typed those SNPs that comprised hapB and hapC as well as the Ser37Ala variant.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2160	For all six tests, two phenotypes times three variants, the patients have a higher frequency of the variant compared to the controls, and the estimated RRs are overall comparable to those observed in the Icelanders.	[[152, 154]]	[]	['RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2161	Nonetheless, hapC gives a p value of 0.0038 for low BMD, which is significant even after adjusting for the six tests performed.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2162	The Ser37Ala missense variant is nominally significant for osteoporotic fractures, with an estimated RR of 4.2, and hapB is nominally significant for low BMD, with an estimated RR of 2.1..	[[154, 157], [101, 103], [177, 179]]	[]	['BMD', 'RR', 'RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2163	For the Danish cohort, hapX is estimated to have a frequency of 16.3% in the low BMD patients versus 7.3% in controls, giving a one-sided p value of 0.004 with an RR of 2.5.	[[81, 84], [163, 165]]	[]	['BMD', 'RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2164	The frequency of hapX in the osteoporotic fracture patients is estimated to be 15.3%, giving a one-sided p value of 0.037 with an RR of 2.2..	[[130, 132]]	[]	['RR']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2165	We investigated the presence of other genes besides BMP2 within the region covered by the disease-associated haplotypes.	[[52, 56]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2166	All predicted exons and ESTs in the region were considered potential exons in yet undiscovered genes.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['EST']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2167	Reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) was performed using RNA from a fetal osteoblastic cell line and bone marrow, where the PCR primers were designed so as to connect adjacent exons of a particular predicted open reading frame or ESTs.	[[247, 250], [49, 52], [141, 144], [46, 52]]	[[19, 44]]	['EST', 'PCR', 'PCR', 'RT–PCR']	['polymerase chain reaction']	PMC270020.nxml
2168	We therefore conclude that the BMP2 gene is the only gene within the region of the haplotype variants..	[[31, 35]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2169	Case–control association analyses using firstly Icelandic samples and subsequently replicated with an independent Danish cohort support BMP2 as the gene, or one of the genes, in the region contributing to osteoporosis risk.	[[136, 140]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2170	We applied a novel definition of the osteoporosis phenotype, based on corrected BMD values at both the spine and the hip in the same analysis (a more generalized osteoporosis) in addition to including osteoporotic fractures.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2171	Hitherto, osteoporotic fractures have not been used as a phenotype in any linkage scan reported, neither on their own nor in combination with BMD values.	[[142, 145]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2172	All previously reported linkage studies were based on the use of BMD at specific skeletal sites as a quantitative trait in the analysis.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2173	We have also observed that pedigrees with low BMD are not a rarity in the population, as has been suggested (Peacock et al.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2174	However, the skeletal site of low BMD could vary, not necessarily being the same site among the relatives nor among all members within a particular pedigree.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2175	This observation is also consistent with our linkage results, applying a combination of both the hip and the spine BMD measurements in the same analysis.	[[115, 118]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2176	Our skeletal site-specific linkage runs both confirm the results on the Chromosome 20p locus and also show that there are other potential loci that seem to be more site specific; however, the LOD scores at these loci did not reach genome-wide significance..	[[192, 195]]	[]	['LOD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2177	Four of the genes in the region are expressed in an osteoblast cell line or in bone marrow (BMP2, C20orf42, C20orf154, and CHGB).	[[92, 96]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2178	However, initial association analysis did draw attention to the BMP2 gene, which is a priori a strong candidate gene, based on its role in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation (Wozney et al.	[[64, 68]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2179	Our analysis indicates that the influence of BMP2 on the development of osteoporosis is that on the attainment on peak bone mass, rather than increased bone loss.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2180	The role of BMP2 in this process is probably through stimulating the differentiation and/or activity of osteoblasts.	[[12, 16]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2181	The number of differentiated osteoblasts may be lower, or their BMP2-induced activity lower, in individuals who attain low peak bone mass.	[[64, 68]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2182	The nature of the underlying haplotype variations in the BMP2 gene is not evident, nor is the effect of the Ser37Ala missense variant.	[[57, 61]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2183	Given the diverse role of BMP2 (Wozney et al.	[[26, 30]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2184	The variants have comparable frequencies and estimated risks in this second European population, supporting the hypothesis that the association of BMP2 with osteoporosis is not unique to the Icelandic population.	[[147, 151]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2185	Hence, we hope that the promising results presented here will stimulate other replication studies, necessary to further confirm and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the role of BMP2 in osteoporosis.	[[190, 194]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2186	Moreover, even if all of our identified at-risk variants were to be confirmed in replication studies, the fact that they cannot fully explain the linkage signal implies that there may be other genes in the region also contributing to the linkage signal or that there are other at-risk variants of BMP2 that have yet to be identified..	[[297, 301]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2187	Variants in BMP2 may also be useful in addressing the unmet medical need of identifying those at increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures..	[[12, 16]]	[]	['BMP2']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2188	The study group was drawn from a large number of individuals who have had BMD measurements at the National University Hospital of Iceland.	[[74, 77]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2189	Individuals with age-matched BMD (Z score) less than 1 SD below average were invited to participate in the study.	[[29, 32], [55, 57]]	[]	['BMD', 'SD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2190	The BMD of all participants, including relatives, was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L2–L4) in posterior–anterior projection and at the total hip (proximal end of femur) and whole body (QDR 4500A, Hologic, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States).	[[4, 7]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2191	Weight and height were measured at the time of BMD measurement.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2192	The BMD values were corrected for sex and age to yield the standard Z score, using reference data on 1,407 BMD measurements on randomly collected individuals in Iceland who had not received therapy influencing BMD, thus creating a population-specific reference for corrections.	[[4, 7], [107, 110], [210, 213]]	[]	['BMD', 'BMD', 'BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2193	Validation of fractures through medical records (clinical history, X-rays, hospital records) was, however, done for individuals who reported low-impact fractures but had BMD values higher than 1 SD below average.	[[170, 173], [195, 197]]	[]	['BMD', 'SD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2194	Also, individuals who were suspected to suffer from diseases or deficiencies that influence BMD were also excluded as affected.	[[92, 95]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2195	If available, an early BMD measurement from before the beginning of hormone replacement therapy or the treatment of bisphosphonates was used..	[[23, 26]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2196	There were 1,323 individuals with BMD measurements, corrected for age, sex, and weight, as indicated above, and regardless of whether the measurements were high or low, who formed the linkage cohort.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['BMD']	[]	PMC270020.nxml
2197	A subset of these groups, both patients and controls, were typed for the Ser37Ala variant, since this required sequencing for typing instead of our routine fluorescent polarization template-directed dye-terminator incorporation (FP–TDI) assay for SNP typing (see below)..

2202	For the association tests performed for the Ser37Ala variant, if we do not adjust for the familial relationships among some of the affected, the p values are anticonservative, but the estimated RRs are not biased because one can consider the relatedness as having an effect on the variance but not the mean of a test statistic.

2245	Transition between the ferric and iron-free states of Tf involves significant conformational changes (Grossmann et al.	[[54, 56]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2246	In vivo, these conformational changes presumably take place while Tf is bound to TfR, as the two proteins remain complexed throughout endocytosis and recycling (Dautry-Varsat et al.	[[66, 68], [81, 84]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2247	Free Fe-Tf releases iron at acidic pH, but binding to TfR affects the iron release at both basic and acidic pH (Bali and Aisen 1991, 1992; Bali et al.	[[5, 10], [8, 10], [54, 57]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2248	At pH 7.4, iron release from Fe-Tf bound to TfR is slower than from free Fe-Tf.	[[29, 34], [32, 34], [44, 47]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2249	At low pH, the opposite effect is observed, such that binding to TfR significantly increases the iron-release rate (Bali and Aisen 1991, 1992; Bali et al.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2250	Attempts to determine the mechanism by which TfR mediates these effects on the iron release rate have been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of the binding footprints of Fe-Tf and apo-Tf on TfR and by the unavailability of crystal structures of Fe-Tf or apo-Tf bound to TfR..	[[187, 193], [261, 267], [177, 182], [252, 257], [180, 182], [191, 193], [255, 257], [265, 267], [45, 48], [197, 200], [277, 280]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2251	Although the structural details of the interaction between Tf and TfR remain unknown, early studies established that two Tf molecules bind to each TfR homodimer (Enns and Sussman 1981) by primarily interacting with what is now structurally defined as the TfR helical domain (Buchegger et al.	[[59, 61], [121, 123], [66, 69], [147, 150], [255, 258]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2252	A subsequent mutagenesis study further localized the binding site to include a conserved RGD sequence (residues 646–648) within the TfR helical domain (Dubljevic et al.	[[132, 135]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2253	The HFE/TfR co-crystal structure revealed that HFE directly contacts TfR residues 646 and 648 (Bennett et al.	[[47, 50], [8, 11], [69, 72]]	[]	['HFE', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2254	2000), which is consistent with biochemical inhibition studies that suggested that HFE and Tf bind to the same or an overlapping site on TfR (Lebrón et al.	[[83, 86], [91, 93], [137, 140]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2255	As Fe-Tf is a large protein (approximately 90Å × 50Å × 40 Å, measured using the structure of iron-bound ovo-Tf [Kurokawa et al.	[[3, 8], [6, 8], [108, 110]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2256	1995]), the remainder of the Tf contact site on TfR could include other TfR domains, the TfR interdomain cleft, or both (Figure 1B), as previously suggested (Lawrence et al.	[[29, 31], [48, 51], [72, 75], [89, 92]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2257	A subsequent mutagenesis study sought to identify other Tf-contacting residues on TfR (West et al.	[[56, 58], [82, 85]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2258	In that study, residues identified from the HFE/TfR co-crystal structure as involved in contacting HFE were mutated, and their effects on binding to HFE and Fe-Tf were quantitatively evaluated.

2259	These experiments identified several residues within the TfR helical domain that are involved in binding to each protein (defined as a substitution producing a greater than or equal to 5-fold reduction in binding affinity) and confirmed that the Fe-Tf- and HFE-binding sites on TfR overlap.

2260	However, the larger size of Tf relative to the HFE ectodomain (679 amino acids in Tf compared with 374 for the HFE/β2-microglobulin ectodomain) suggested that Fe-Tf could contact residues outside of the TfR helical domain.

2261	Also, the effects of the TfR substitutions on binding to apo-Tf were not evaluated; thus, the question of whether Fe-Tf and apo-Tf bind differently to TfR was not addressed..

2264	As expected, the most important residues for Tf binding are located in the center of the TfR helical domain in the vicinity of critical residues for HFE binding.	[[149, 152], [45, 47], [89, 92]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml

2267	This information, together with the identification of common Fe-Tf- and apo-Tf-contacting residues within the helical domain, constrains the possible positions of Fe-Tf and apo-Tf on TfR, allowing for construction of structural models for the placement of the two forms of Tf on TfR.

2271	Four substitutions at the HFE-binding site on the TfR helical domain (L619A, R629A, Y643A, and F650A) were found to significantly reduce (greater than or equal to 5-fold) the binding affinity for both HFE and Fe-Tf at pH 7.5, giving a first-order map of the Fe-Tf-binding site on TfR (West et al.

2293	Our previous mutagenesis study established that both the HFE- and Fe-Tf-binding sites on TfR include residues within helices 1 and 3 of the TfR helical domain (West et al.	[[66, 71], [57, 60], [69, 71], [89, 92], [140, 143]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2294	In the present study, we tested the previously prepared TfR mutants for binding apo-Tf at pH 6.3 and re-evaluated their binding to HFE and Fe-Tf at pH 7.5.	[[80, 86], [139, 144], [131, 134], [84, 86], [142, 144], [56, 59]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2295	In agreement with the previous results, we found that two mutants, L619A and Y643A, showed no detectable HFE binding and a significant (greater than or equal to 5-fold) decrease in Fe-Tf binding.	[[181, 186], [105, 108], [184, 186]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2296	These substitutions also significantly reduced apo-Tf binding at acidic pH.	[[47, 53], [51, 53]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2297	Two other mutants, R629A and Q640A, were again found to significantly reduce HFE binding and to have a relatively minor effect on Fe-Tf binding (R629A) or no significant effect (Q640A).	[[130, 135], [77, 80], [133, 135]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2298	The effects of these substitutions on apo-Tf binding correlated with their effects on Fe-Tf binding.	[[38, 44], [86, 91], [42, 44], [89, 91]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2299	Likewise, the F650A mutant, which shows a moderate reduction in binding affinity for both HFE and Fe-Tf, also shows a reduced affinity for binding apo-Tf.	[[98, 103], [90, 93], [101, 103]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2300	Only one of the previously analyzed mutants, G647A, exhibited a major (greater than 100-fold) reduction in Fe-Tf binding affinity, and the present analysis reveals that it has a similar effect on apo-Tf binding.

2301	Interestingly, one of the previously analyzed mutants, W641A, which does not significantly affect HFE or Fe-Tf binding at pH 7.5, exerted a significant reduction in the binding affinity for apo-Tf at pH 6.3 (see Table 1; Figure 1E; Figure 2), suggesting that it might be possible to find additional substitutions with differential effects on binding of the two forms of Tf..

2302	Our first strategy for finding additional residues critical for Tf binding involved substitution of solvent-exposed residues C-terminal to the Tf-binding epitope residues Gly647 and Phe650 on helix 3 of the TfR helical domain.	[[64, 66], [143, 145], [207, 210]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2303	Of the five new TfR mutants constructed (R651A, S654A, T658A, N662A, E664A), only one (R651A) affected Tf binding, resulting in a greater than 2,800-fold reduction in binding of Fe-Tf and apo-Tf.	[[178, 183], [103, 105], [181, 183], [16, 19]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2304	Having identified a “hot spot” for Tf binding involving TfR helical domain residues Gly647 and Arg651, we then searched for residues affecting Tf binding that were distant from this site, which would allow approximate positioning of the bi-lobed Tf structure on TfR.	[[35, 37], [143, 145], [246, 248], [56, 59]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2305	Two residues within the cleft formed by portions of the three TfR domains were changed to their chicken TfR counterparts to test the prediction that Tf binds to the TfR interdomain cleft (Lawrence et al.	[[149, 151], [62, 65], [104, 107], [165, 168]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2306	There were no significant differences in Tf binding affinity for either the P710R or the K717Q mutants, suggesting that at least this region of the interdomain cleft is not critical for binding to either form of Tf.	[[41, 43]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2307	Consistent with this interpretation, we found a second binding site at the base of the TfR protease-like domain that is distant from the interdomain cleft (approximately 46 Å).	[[87, 90]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2308	The Y123S mutant, which was constructed as part of a screen to test the effects of changing large solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, shows a significantly reduced affinity for Fe-Tf, but not to apo-Tf or HFE.	[[197, 203], [179, 184], [182, 184], [201, 203]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2309	To confirm that Tyr123 forms part of the Fe-Tf-binding site, three additional mutants were constructed: the double mutant Y123S/G647A and the two single mutants W124A and D125K.	[[41, 46], [44, 46]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2310	The double mutant showed an increased effect on Fe-Tf binding compared to the G647A alone, consistent with the involvement of Tyr123 in Fe-Tf binding.	[[48, 53], [136, 141], [51, 53], [139, 141]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2311	In addition, the W124A and D125K single mutants, which change residues adjacent to Tyr123, also reduced TfR's affinity for Fe-Tf, but not apo-Tf.	[[123, 128], [126, 128]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2312	Thus, the base of the protease-like domain in the vicinity of Tyr123 is involved in differential binding to the iron-loaded form of Tf, but not apo-Tf.	[[132, 134]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2313	None of the other substitutions constructed in the screen of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues significantly affected binding to either form of Tf or to HFE..	[[156, 159], [147, 149]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2314	As Tf is a bi-lobed structure, it should be possible to evaluate the binding of isolated lobes to wild-type and mutant TfRs to gain information regarding the positions of the two Tf lobes on TfR.	[[3, 5], [179, 181], [119, 122]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2315	Isolated iron-loaded Tf C-lobe (Fe-C-lobe) binds to TfR with an affinity of approximately 650 nM (Zak et al.	[[32, 41], [21, 23], [52, 55]]	[]	['Fe-C-lobe', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2316	Assuming independent binding of the two Tf lobes without effects of cooperativity, the affinity increase to a KD of approximately 1 nM for intact Fe-Tf binding to TfR suggests the KD for binding isolated N-lobe would be approximately 1.5 mM.	[[146, 151], [110, 112], [180, 182], [40, 42], [149, 151], [163, 166]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'KD', 'KD', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2317	Consistent with this assumption, isolated Tf N-lobe neither binds detectably to TfR nor donates iron to TfR-expressing cells (Zak et al.	[[42, 44], [80, 83], [104, 107]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2318	We therefore tested purified Fe-C-lobe (Zak and Aisen 2002) for binding to wild-type TfR and selected TfR mutants..	[[29, 38], [85, 88], [102, 105]]	[]	['Fe-C-lobe', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2319	Fe-C-lobe was injected over wild-type TfR and TfR mutants (Y123S, D125K, R651A, F760A) in a biosensor binding assay as described for Fe-Tf above.	[[133, 138], [136, 138], [38, 41], [46, 49]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2320	Binding data were analyzed using an equilibrium-based approach because the rapid kinetics of the Fe-C-lobe interaction with wild-type TfR do not allow accurate derivation of kinetic rate constants (Figure 3).	[[97, 106], [134, 137]]	[]	['Fe-C-lobe', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2321	No significant changes in affinity were observed for Fe-C-lobe binding to two mutants in the TfR protease-like domain (Y123S, D125K), but a mutation in the central portion of the Fe-Tf functional epitope on TfR, R651A, eliminated detectable binding (Figure 3).

2322	In addition, binding of Fe-C-lobe was not significantly affected by the F760A mutation in the TfR helical domain, which reduces the affinity of apo-Tf, but not Fe-Tf (see Figure 2; Table 1).

2323	These results suggest that Tf C-lobe contacts the TfR helical domain, but not the protease-like domain..	[[27, 29], [50, 53]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2324	Plots of the equilibrium binding response, normalized to the Rmax value (the ligand immobilization value) derived from fitting, versus concentration of injected Fe-C-lobe, are shown for the indicated TfR mutants along with the wild-type TfR control that was present in an adjacent flow cell on the same biosensor chip.

2327	Despite many years of investigation of the Tf/TfR pathway for iron uptake, molecular details about the interaction between TfR and Tf have been limited largely due to a lack of structural information for a Tf/TfR complex.

2328	To narrow down a subset of residues for mutageneis from the 639 residues in a soluble TfR monomer, we used the crystal structures of TfR alone (Lawrence et al.	[[86, 89], [133, 136]]	[]	['TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2329	1999) and TfR bound to HFE (Bennett et al.	[[23, 26], [10, 13]]	[]	['HFE', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2330	2000) to locate solvent-exposed residues in the vicinity of the HFE-binding site, which was suggested from competition studies to overlap with the Tf-binding site on TfR (Lebrón et al.	[[64, 67], [147, 149], [166, 169]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2331	We identified residues within the TfR helical domain whose substitution affected binding of both HFE and Fe-Tf at pH 7.5 in a previous mutagenesis study involving ten human TfR mutants (West et al.	[[105, 110], [97, 100], [108, 110], [34, 37], [173, 176]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2332	These results established that HFE and Fe-Tf bind to the same or an overlapping site on TfR.	[[39, 44], [31, 34], [42, 44]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2333	In the present study, we have expanded the library of TfR mutants to more precisely map the Tf-binding site on TfR and compared binding of Fe-Tf and apo-Tf to TfR.	[[149, 155], [139, 144], [92, 94], [142, 144], [153, 155], [54, 57], [111, 114]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2334	From a survey of 29 point mutants of human TfR, we identified 11 residues, which, when substituted, reduce the affinity of TfR for either human Fe-Tf, apo-Tf, or both (see Table 1).	[[151, 157], [144, 149], [147, 149], [155, 157], [43, 46], [123, 126]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2335	Six of the 11 residues are completely conserved in different species of TfR and in a more recently identified Tf-binding receptor, TfR2, which shares 45% sequence identity with TfR (Kawabata et al.	[[110, 112], [72, 75], [177, 180]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2336	Most notably, four of the residues exerting the largest effects on Fe-Tf binding, apo-Tf binding, or both (Leu619, Trp641, Gly647, and Arg651) are completely conserved across all currently known TfR and TfR2 sequences (see Table 1).

2337	Others, such as the tyrosines at positions 123 and 643, are either conserved or conservatively substituted for phenylalanine in some TfR species.	[[133, 136]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2338	By contrast, of the 18 positions at which substitutions did not significantly affect Tf binding, 16 are not conserved, and two (Phe187 and Glu664) are conservatively substituted (see Table 1).	[[85, 87]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2339	These results suggest that our conclusions about the mode of binding between human Tf and human TfR can be generalized to include Tf/TfR complexes from other species and the interaction between TfR2 and Tf..	[[83, 85], [203, 205], [96, 99], [133, 136]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2340	From a quantitative analysis of the affinities of the different TfR mutants for Fe-Tf and apo-Tf, we can classify the residues we mutated using the criteria of Wells and colleagues (Cunningham and Wells 1993), which categorize the structural and functional epitope residues in a protein–protein interaction.	[[90, 96], [80, 85], [83, 85], [94, 96], [64, 67]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2341	This is illustrated in our study by comparing the crystallographically-defined structural epitope on TfR for binding HFE (Bennett et al.	[[117, 120], [101, 104]]	[]	['HFE', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2342	2000) (see Figure 1A and 1B; Table 1; Figure S1) with the results of mutagenic mapping of residues affecting HFE binding (see Figure 1C).	[[109, 112]]	[]	['HFE']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2343	In the absence of a Tf/TfR co-crystal structure, we can use our mutagenesis results to predict the functional and structural epitope residues (affinity reductions of greater than or equal to 30-fold or between 5- and 30-fold, respectively) on TfR for binding to Fe-Tf and apo-Tf.	[[262, 267], [265, 267], [23, 26], [243, 246]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2344	From the comparison of wild-type and mutant TfR binding affinities, Arg651 was identified as a functional epitope residue for binding both Fe-Tf at pH 7.5 and binding apo-Tf at pH 6.3, as substitution of this single residue to alanine greatly reduces binding to either form of Tf (see Table 1).	[[167, 173], [139, 144], [142, 144], [171, 173], [277, 279], [44, 47]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2345	2001), which reduces affinity for both Fe-Tf and apo-Tf by over 100-fold, these residues define a functional epitope for Fe-Tf and apo-Tf binding located in the bottom central portion of the TfR helical domain (see Figure 1D and 1E).	[[49, 55], [131, 137], [39, 44], [121, 126], [42, 44], [53, 55], [124, 126], [135, 137], [191, 194]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2346	The HFE/TfR crystal structure shows that these residues are at the contact interface with HFE (see Figure 1A and 1B) (Bennett et al.	[[90, 93], [8, 11]]	[]	['HFE', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2347	2000), but with the exception of Leu619, their substitutions do not significantly affect HFE binding (see Table 1).	[[89, 92]]	[]	['HFE']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2348	Instead, the functional epitope for HFE binding is shifted slightly upwards on the TfR helical domain from the Fe-Tf functional epitope to include residues Leu619 and Tyr643 (see Figure 1C).	[[111, 116], [36, 39], [114, 116], [83, 86]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2349	Thus, although most of the functional epitope residues for binding of HFE and Tf are physically separated, they are close enough that binding of either HFE or Fe-Tf to TfR would sterically preclude binding of the other species (see Figure 1C and 1D).

2350	In addition, some substitutions in TfR significantly lower the affinity for both HFE and Tf (L619A, R629A, Y643A, and F650A) (see Table 1)..	[[81, 84], [89, 91], [35, 38]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2351	Since Tf is a larger molecule than HFE, we reasoned that Tf could also interact with residues not contained in the HFE binding footprint on TfR.	[[35, 38], [115, 118], [6, 8], [57, 59]]	[]	['HFE', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2352	We therefore tested substitutions of residues outside of the TfR helical domain for their effects on binding to Tf.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2353	We also restricted the search to residues within approximately 90 Å (the longest dimension of Fe-Tf) of the Fe-Tf functional-binding epitope for substitution.	[[94, 99], [108, 113], [97, 99], [111, 113]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2354	Using this strategy, we identified a region at the base of the protease-like domain involving residues Tyr123, Trp124, and Asp125, where substitutions showed significant effects on binding to Fe-Tf at pH 7.5, but not to HFE at pH 7.5 or to apo-Tf at pH 6.3 (see Figure 1D and 1E; Table 1).

2355	Having defined two predicted Fe-Tf contact areas on TfR that are separated by approximately 33 Å (measured between TfR residues Arg651 and Tyr123) constrains the ways in which Tf can interact with TfR.

2356	In particular, computer modeling suggests that a single Tf lobe cannot make productive contacts with both regions of TfR (A.	[[56, 58], [117, 120]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2357	Giannetti, unpublished data); thus both lobes of Fe-Tf are likely to be involved in the interface with TfR.	[[49, 54], [52, 54]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2358	Previous studies of the binding of isolated Fe-N- and Fe-C-lobes of Tf suggested that the majority of the binding energy in the Tf/TfR interaction comes from the C-lobe (Zak et al.	[[54, 63], [68, 70], [131, 134]]	[]	['Fe-C-lobe', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2359	It has also been observed that mixing purified N- and C-lobes results in a significant enhancement of TfR binding over that of C-lobe alone (Mason et al.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2360	These observations are consistent with a Tf orientation on TfR in which the C-lobe contacts the Tf functional epitope on the TfR helical domain and the N-lobe contacts the Tyr123 area at the base of the TfR protease-like domain (Figure 4).

2361	To test the predicted orientation of Tf on TfR (Figure 4), we compared the affinities of isolated Fe-C-lobe (Zak and Aisen 2002) to wild-type TfR and to TfR mutants with substitutions in the helical domain (R651A, F760A) and the protease-like domain (Y123S, D125K) (see Figure 3).

2362	As predicted, substitutions in the protease-like domain do not affect binding of Fe-C-lobe, whereas a functional epitope substitution (R651A) in the TfR helical domain eliminates detectable binding of Fe-C-lobe to TfR..

2373	Our binding data also allow us to assess potential differences in the binding of Fe-Tf versus apo-Tf to TfR.	[[94, 100], [81, 86], [84, 86], [98, 100]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml

2375	First, Fe-Tf undergoes a large conformational change upon acidification and release of iron, as deduced by comparison of crystal structures of ferric and iron-free forms of Tf and Tf-related molecules such as the lactoferrins (Bailey et al.

2376	Second, TfR has been suggested to undergo a pH-dependent conformational change resulting in aggregation at pH <6 in the absence of Tf (Turkewitz et al.	[[131, 133], [8, 11]]	[]	['Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2377	Our finding of differential effects of TfR substitutions for binding Fe-Tf at pH 7.5 versus apo-Tf at pH 6.3 is consistent with conformational changes in Tf,TfR, or both at acidic pH.

2378	We find one TfR region that affects binding of Fe-Tf, but not apo-Tf (the region near Tyr123 involving TfR residues 123–125 at the base of the protease-like domain), and another region that affects binding of apo-Tf, but not Fe-Tf or Fe-C-lobe (the region defined by Trp641 and Phe760, two spatially proximal residues [10.2 Å apart] at the edge of the TfR helical domain) (see Figure 1E and 1F).

2379	The apo-Tf-specific binding site may be important for TfR's ability to significantly accelerate iron release from receptor-bound Fe-Tf (Bali and Aisen 1991).	[[4, 10], [129, 134], [8, 10], [132, 134]]	[]	['apo-Tf', 'Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2380	Taking all of our data into account, we propose the following structure-based mechanism to explain TfR-assisted iron release from Fe-Tf (see Figure 4; Video S1)..	[[130, 135], [133, 135], [99, 102]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2381	First, Fe-Tf binds to TfR at pH 7.5, with the C-lobe making critical contacts to the TfR region defined by Arg651 in the helical domain and the N-lobe making additional favorable contacts with the second Tf-binding site defined by Tyr123, Trp124, and Asp125.

2382	The interaction of the complementary surfaces on each protein presumably limits Fe-Tf's freedom to sample more open states, thereby favoring the closed iron-bound state and lowering the iron release rate from both Tf lobes.	[[214, 216]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml

2384	Second, as the pH is lowered, protonation of key residues in Fe-Tf allows it to sample open conformations that facilitate iron release (Navati et al.	[[61, 66], [64, 66]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2385	A conformational change in Tf, TfR, or both allows additional Tf interactions between Tf and the hydrophobic binding surface defined by TfR residues Trp641 and Phe760.	[[27, 29], [62, 64], [86, 88], [31, 34], [136, 139]]	[]	['Tf', 'Tf', 'Tf', 'TfR', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2386	These new interactions stabilize Tf in an open conformation exposing the iron-binding site and thereby enhancing the rate of iron release..	[[33, 35]]	[]	['Tf']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2387	The extensive mutagenic mapping of ligand binding to TfR reported here has revealed residues responsible for functional binding to HFE, Fe-Tf, and apo-Tf.	[[136, 141], [131, 134], [139, 141], [53, 56]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2388	These data confirm that HFE and Tf bind to a physically and functionally overlapping site on the TfR helical domain, although the most important receptor residues for binding are different for the two proteins.	[[24, 27], [32, 34], [97, 100]]	[]	['HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2389	Thus, HFE and Fe-Tf must compete with each other for binding to cell surface TfR, which may have functional significance in HFE's role in maintaining iron homeostasis (Townsend and Drakesmith 2002).	[[14, 19], [6, 9], [17, 19], [77, 80]]	[]	['Fe-Tf', 'HFE', 'Tf', 'TfR']	[]	PMC300677.nxml
2390	Additionally, we have found that Fe-Tf makes specific contacts not only to the TfR helical domain through its C-lobe, but also to the TfR protease-like domain, which implies that there are specific N-lobe/TfR contacts contributing to Tf binding.

2391	Finally, our demonstration that Fe-Tf and apo-Tf have different binding footprints on the surface of TfR provides insight into the mechanism by which TfR binding differentially affects iron release rates from Fe-Tf at acidic and basic pH..

2505	Still, sufficient numbers of peptide–MHC complexes bound to a given cell can compensate for relatively low affinity of a single peptide–MHC–TCR interaction.	[[37, 40], [140, 143]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2506	In fact, a simple order of magnitude calculation shows that for a typical peptide–MHC concentration, as few as approximately 200 peptide–MHC–TCR interactions are sufficient to capture and stably hold a cell against typical flow forces experienced during the washing of unbound cells (an example of this calculation is provided in the Supporting Information section)..	[[82, 85], [141, 144]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2507	Further improvement might be achieved by increased exposure of cells to each MHC-printed region (e.g., by sample agitation, reloading, or directed flow).	[[77, 80]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2508	Another route towards a significant improvement in both sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio is cell enrichment prior to MHC array analysis.	[[122, 125]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2509	For example, preselection of CD8+ or CD4+ from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (e.g., by bead selection or FACS sorting) results in approximately a 10-fold enrichment of specific target cells and eliminates the nonspecific binding of a subpopulation of CD11b+ cells to MHC spots.	[[110, 114], [272, 275]]	[]	['FACS', 'MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2510	The number of cells captured on the array depends on the abundance of cells expressing the appropriate TCR, its expression level, and affinity to the peptide–MHC complex, the concentration, functionality, and accessibility of that complex, and several other factors, including the local cell density, incubation, and washing conditions, local film, integrity etc.	[[158, 161], [103, 106]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2511	The use of printed arrays of specific binding reagents for characterizing populations of cells has similarities to FACS in concept and applications.	[[115, 119]]	[]	['FACS']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2512	Currently, a single cellular microarray can accommodate more than 1,000 peptide–MHC probes (without decreasing the spot size), which allows detection of 1,000 antigen-specific cell populations in a single assay.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2513	Each cellular microarray-based assay is easy to perform, utilizes fixed gating that eliminates the subjective gating of FACS-based analysis, and allows many samples to be analyzed side by side either on the same slide (for small arrays) or on different slides.	[[120, 124]]	[]	['FACS']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2514	The high throughput should make it practical to screen a sample population of cells (e.g., from a patient) against a large panel of candidate peptide–MHC complexes or to discover novel MHC-restricted epitopes by screening libraries of random, mutated, and chemically modified sequences.	[[150, 153], [185, 188]]	[]	['MHC', 'MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2515	Although the fractional abundance of specific T cells required for detection in our experiments (0.1%) is not as low as can be detected in the best FACS analyses (0.01%), it is already sufficient to identify an immune response of clinical relevance and is likely to improve with further optimization..	[[148, 152]]	[]	['FACS']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2516	What are the prospects for efficient array-based detection of immune responses and characterization of the TCR recognition and activation landscape? The actual set of TCR specificities and sensitivities, at any given time, depends on the history of exposure to antigens, genotype, and the physiological parameters.	[[107, 110], [167, 170]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2517	We have shown that a physiologically relevant response to an antigen challenge is detectable as cell capture by the cognate peptide–MHC (see Figure 4).	[[132, 135]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2518	1999), a signature of binding to multiple peptides is also possible, especially for structurally similar epitopes (high surface concentration of the peptide–MHC may further contribute to the ability to capture cross-reacting T cells).	[[157, 160]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2519	In one case, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a single patient recognized tyrosinase (a differentiation antigen presented by human leucocyte antigen [HLA] class I), β-catenin (a class I mutation), p15 (a class I antigen involved in posttranscriptional control), gp100 (a class I intronic sequence and class II normal sequence), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1, a class II differentiation antigen), TRP-2 (a class II differentiation antigen), and Ki-67 (a class II mutation)..

2520	This drawback may be mitigated by modifying the geometry of the array and/or the sample introduction method so as to increase the chances of rare cell populations encountering each of the peptide–MHC complexes..	[[196, 199]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2521	Taking advantage of the full potential of this approach requires convenient means for synthesizing diverse arrays of peptide–MHC complexes.	[[125, 128]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2522	Conventional MHC tetramer synthesis is cumbersome and technically difficult, making the effective implementation of large, functional peptide–MHC libraries a practical challenge.	[[13, 16], [142, 145]]	[]	['MHC', 'MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2523	However, usage of reloadable MHC constructs such as DimerX (BD Biosciences) or the MHC tetramer-based Epitope Discovery System (Beckman Coulter) should allow for an efficient production of printable MHC molecules loaded with diverse peptide epitopes of interest.	[[29, 32], [83, 86], [199, 202]]	[]	['MHC', 'MHC', 'MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2524	Indeed, preliminary experiments suggest that the DimerX peptide-loadable reagent has a similar specificity and sensitivity to that of peptide–MHC tetramers..	[[142, 145]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2525	This technique can be performed rapidly (10 min), requires little technical expertise, and allows screening of a single clinical sample (with CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells) against a library of specific or random peptide–MHCs.	[[216, 219]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2526	Numerous clinically significant MHC-restricted epitopes have already been defined.	[[32, 35]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2527	Thus, the development of peptide–MHC cellular microarrays should provide valuable insights into dynamic and individual variations in the global repertoire of T cell specificities and the mechanisms that control them..	[[33, 36]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml

2542	Labeled or unlabeled cells were directly added to the peptide–MHC array by gentle layering in volumes of 20–50 μl.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml

2546	FACS analysis of the same population of cells was performed as detailed above, with anti-CD8–FITC mAb, OVA/Kb SA–PE tetramer, and an HIV gag 77–85/ HLA-A*0201 SA–PerCP dump tetramer.	[[93, 97], [148, 151], [98, 101], [113, 115]]	[]	['FITC', 'HLA', 'mAb', 'PE']	[]	PMC300678.nxml

2548	To determine whether the MHC array could be used to probe intact lymphocyte activation pathways, OT-1 lymphocytes were loaded with 5 μg/ml calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2549	The lymphocytes were then exposed to an MHC array containing OVA/Kb, LCMV/Kd, MCC/Ek, anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 spots.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2550	A DIC image, a Cy3 (for DiI or PE), a Cy5 (DiD) and/or a FITC (DiO) image, and/or 340 nm and 380 nm images were collected every 30 s for up to 1 h.	[[2, 5], [57, 61], [31, 33]]	[]	['DIC', 'FITC', 'PE']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2551	Indeed, a 4-fold increase in the amount of tetramer deposited leads to a significant increase in binding efficiency, which becomes comparable to binding via a mAb (data not shown).	[[159, 162]]	[]	['mAb']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2552	The lack of cell binding between spots or to noncognate peptide–MHC spots indicates that binding of as low as a few cells is attributable to peptide–MHC–TCR recognition.	[[64, 67], [153, 156]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2553	Likewise, the minimal concentration for binding depends on the availability and functionality of the immobilized peptide–MHC, the peptide–MHC–TCR affinity, the type, density, and heterogeneity of the cells, the incubation temperature and duration, and the stringency of washing..	[[121, 124], [142, 145]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2554	In general, the binding curve should depend on the immobilization kinetics, the heterogeneity in TCR expression level, and its affinity to the peptide–MHC complex.	[[151, 154], [97, 100]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2555	Indeed, in some other peptide–MHC–TCR systems (and higher suspension densities), the binding curve has a sigmoidal shape (data not shown).	[[34, 37]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2556	Heterogeneity in TCR affinity and expression level should lead to a less steep increase in captured cell number as a function of surface ligand density.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2557	Therefore, the linear binding curve (Figure S1B) probably reflects a wide distribution of TCR expression levels and/or affinities and should not be considered as a pure statement on binding kinetics.	[[90, 93]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2558	The excellent performance of peptide–MHC complexes as binding probes in an array format was somewhat surprising because the typical TCR affinity is about 103- to 104-fold lower than that of a typical mAb and its antigen (Davis et al.	[[200, 203], [37, 40], [132, 135]]	[]	['mAb', 'MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2559	Still, sufficient numbers of peptide–MHC complexes bound to a given cell can compensate for relatively low affinity of a single peptide–MHC–TCR bond.	[[37, 40], [140, 143]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2560	By incorporating kinetic parameters specific to the OT-1/OVA tetramer interaction into a simplified adhesion model proposed by Bell (1978), the actual number of OT-1/OVA/Kb tetramer bonds can be estimated as follows.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['OVA']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2561	Assuming that only about 1% of the tetramers are actually available for binding, the critical force per bond, above which a cell cannot be stably bound to the surface (Bell 1978), is given by fc ≈ 6 × 10−12 × Ln (Ns/KD(2d)) ≈ 35pN/bond, where Ns is the effective surface concentration of the tetramer and KD(2d) is the estimated two-dimensional dissociation constant between the OT-1 TCR and a single OVA/MHC tetramer (KD(2d), ∼ 4 ×108 molecules/cm2)..	[[405, 408], [384, 387]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2562	Hence, for a typical washing velocity of 10 cm/s, the detaching force F = 4nN may be compensated by as few as 114 OT-1/OVA tetramer bonds.	[[119, 122]]	[]	['OVA']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2563	Assuming an interaction area of 15 μm2, the surface concentration of bound OT-1 TCRs at the time of washing must be higher than 7.6/μm2.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2564	Such surface density can be easily achieved even for a uniform TCR surface distribution.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2565	For example, for a T cell of radius a, having a uniform TCR distribution, a surface density of 7.6/μm2 corresponds to a total of 382 TCRs.	[[56, 59], [133, 136]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2566	In a typical OT-1 cell, the TCR expression level is about two orders of magnitude higher than this lower bound.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2567	A more realistic scenario of TCR recruitment to the “artificial immunological synapse” (resulting in a nonuniform TCR distribution) would correspond to an even lower bound..	[[29, 32], [114, 117]]	[]	['TCR', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2568	Thus, given the relevant physiological and kinetic parameters (incorporated into a simplified adhesion model), the major determinant of cell capture is the surface density, Ns, of functional peptide–MHC complexes.	[[199, 202]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2569	For a sufficiently high Ns, the critical force per bond, fc, is high enough to provide for a stable cell capture with as few as a couple hundred peptide–MHC–TCR bonds.	[[157, 160]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2570	Note that the logarithmic dependence of the critical force on both the peptide–MHC surface concentration and the peptide–MHC–TCR affinity (which directly influences the KD(2d)) gives rise to a wide range of Ns and KD(2d) values that are compatible with a stable capture..	[[79, 82], [125, 128]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2571	The effect of tetramer dilution on cell capture was tested by examining the binding of OT-1 lymphocytes to a serial dilution of immobilized OVA/MHC tetramer.	[[144, 147]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2572	Amount of MHC tetramer deposited is given in nanograms per spot..	[[10, 13]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2573	This protocol serves as a general template for a basic MHC cellular microarray experiment.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC300678.nxml
2574	More recently, transposon silencing has been associated with DNA methylation, histone H3 lysine-9 methylation (H3mK9), and RNA interference (RNAi).	[[111, 116], [141, 145]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2575	In contrast, only a small subset of the transposons require the H3mK9 methyltransferase KRYPTONITE, the RNAi gene ARGONAUTE1, and the CXG methyltransferase CHROMOMETHYLASE3.	[[64, 69], [104, 108]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2576	In addition to DNA methylation, transposons are also subject to histone deacetylation, histone H3 lysine-9 methylation (H3mK9), and RNA interference (RNAi) (Rea et al.	[[120, 125], [150, 154]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2577	For example, in Neurospora and Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be triggered by H3mK9 (Tamaru and Selker 2001; Jackson et al.	[[80, 85]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2578	In mammals, methyl CpG-binding proteins recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone H3 lysine-9 methyltransferase (HMT) activity (Nan et al.	[[69, 73], [118, 121]]	[[48, 67]]	['HDAC', 'HMT']	['histone deacetylase']	PMC300680.nxml
2579	Additionally, the mammalian maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, interacts directly with HDACs (Fuks et al.	[[94, 98]]	[]	['HDAC']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2580	Finally, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the RNAi machinery somehow guides the association of H3mK9 with centromeric repeats (Volpe et al.	[[110, 115], [61, 65]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2581	To explore further the interrelationships between epigenetic pathways, we have used several Arabidopsis mutants that affect DNA methylation, H3mK9, and RNAi and that in some cases have been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of transposons.	[[141, 146], [152, 156]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2582	For example, the chromatin remodeling ATPase DDM1 (open reading frame [ORF] At5g66750) (Jeddeloh et al.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['DDM1']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2583	2003), and the HDAC HDA6 (At5g63110) (Murfett et al.	[[15, 19]]	[]	['HDAC']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2584	Further, silencing of the TA3/ATCOPIA44 retrotransposon (At1g37110) requires the DNA methyltransferase CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) (At1g69770), and the HMT KRYPTONITE (KYP)/SUVH4 (At5g13960) (Bartee et al.	[[121, 125], [148, 151], [164, 167]]	[]	['CMT3', 'HMT', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2585	2003) is related to ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) (At1g48410), which is required for RNAi in plants, fungi, and animals (Fagard et al.	[[32, 36], [73, 77]]	[]	['AGO1', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2586	In ddm1, loss of DNA methylation is accompanied by loss of H3mK9 and gain of H3mK4, which is correlated with transcriptional reactivation of transposons (Gendrel et al.	[[59, 64]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2587	2003) and the copia-like elements TA3 and TA2 lose H3mK9 in cmt3 met1 double mutants (Johnson et al.	[[51, 56]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2588	This led to the suggestion that DNA methylation might be responsible for H3mK9, rather than the other way around (Gendrel et al.	[[73, 78]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2589	Neither loss of DNA methylation nor loss of H3mK9 can fully account for the inheritance of active transposons.	[[44, 49]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2590	Rather, the loss of small interfering RNA (siRNA) may also play an important role..	[[43, 48]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2591	We selected five class I retrotransposons and one class II DNA transposon to assess silencing in the Arabidopsis ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) (WT) (Figure 1): the non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon ATLINE1-4 (At2g01840); the gypsy-class LTR retroelements ATLANTYS2-1 (located between At4g03760 and At4g03770), ATLANTYS2-2 (located between At3g43680 and At3g43690), and ATGP1 (At4g03650); the copia-like element ATCOPIA4/COPIA-LIKE23 (At4g16870); and the MULE DNA transposon AtMu1 (At4g08680) (Singer et al.

2592	In order to assess both activation and inheritance, mutants were backcrossed to WT, and F1 seed was planted and used in each assay alongside samples from selfed mutant and WT parents (Figure 1).	[[80, 82], [172, 174]]	[]	['WT', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2593	Pollen from homozygous mutant plants (m/m) was crossed onto WT (+/+) to generate backcrossed BC heterozygous seed (m/+).	[[60, 62]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2594	In WT, transcripts were low or undetectable by PCR amplifying reverse-transcribed cDNA (RT–PCR), and these loci were associated with elevated levels of H3mK9 and reduced levels of H3mK4 according to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis.	[[230, 234], [152, 157], [88, 94], [3, 5]]	[[199, 228]]	['ChIP', 'H3mK9', 'RT–PCR', 'WT']	['chromatin immunoprecipitation']	PMC300680.nxml
2595	Transcripts, unmethylated DNA, and H3mK4 could be detected in the mutants (see Figure 2) and were indicative of the inheritance of activated transposons in backcrossed plants in all cases except ATGP1, which had substantial levels of H3mK4 in WT plants.	[[243, 245]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2596	Methylated DNA and H3mK9 were also measured, but could not be used to assess inheritance, as these were also inherited from silent elements in the WT parent..	[[19, 24], [147, 149]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2597	Reverse-transcribed cDNA (A), ChIP (B), and McrBC-digested genomic DNA (C) were amplified by PCR using primers from five retroelements and one DNA transposon in mutant (m/m) and backcrossed plants (m/+).	[[30, 34]]	[]	['ChIP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2598	Primers corresponded to transcribed ORFs for each element except for AtMu1 ChIP, which was done on the terminal inverted repeat (TIR).	[[75, 79], [36, 39], [129, 132]]	[[103, 127]]	['ChIP', 'ORF', 'TIR']	['terminal inverted repeat']	PMC300680.nxml
2599	(A) Mock RT–PCR was performed without reverse transcriptase (−RT) using primers specific for the Cen180 repeat, which can detect trace amounts of contaminating DNA due to its high-copy number..	[[9, 15]]	[]	['RT–PCR']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2600	(B) ChIP was performed with antibodies recognizing dimethyl lysine-9 (K9) and dimethyl lysine-4 (K4) of histone H3 along with no antibody (na) and total (T) DNA controls.

2601	The Ler genotype is shown.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['Ler']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2602	DNA methylation loss for each element within the mutants and their backcrosses is indicated by loss of band intensity relative to WT as indicated by the arrows or brackets..	[[130, 132]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2603	Transcripts from all six transposons accumulated in ddm1, accompanied by loss of DNA methylation and H3mK9 and gain of H3mK4 (see Figure 2).	[[101, 106]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2604	Interestingly, ATLINE1-4 retained H3mK9 in met1 (see Figure 2B), although it was hypomethylated (Figure 3).	[[34, 39]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2605	Three of these elements, AtMu1, ATCOPIA4, and ATLINE1-4, lost DNA methylation along with H3mK9 (see Figure 2; Figure 3), and two of them, ATCOPIA4 and ATLINE1-4, gained H3mK4 (AtMu1 already had substantial levels in WT).	[[89, 94], [216, 218]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2606	In backcrossed sil1/+ plants, transcripts, DNA hypomethylation, and H3mK4 were restored to WT levels, unlike in ddm1/+ and met1/+, indicating these changes were reversible and not “preset.” Thus, SIL1 can silence transposons de novo when introduced in backcrossed plants (see Figure 1), unlike DDM1 and MET1.	[[294, 298], [91, 93]]	[]	['DDM1', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2607	kyp and cmt3 had much weaker effects on transposon activation, despite widespread loss of H3mK9 in kyp, and on CNG methylation in cmt3 (see Figure 2; Figure 3).	[[90, 95]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2608	Thus, while loss of CG and CNG methylation, loss of H3mK9, and gain of H3mK4 accompany transposon activation, none of these can reliably predict their subsequent inheritance..	[[52, 57]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2609	In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, which lack DNA methylation, transposon silencing is maintained in the germline by RNAi (Plasterk and Ketting 2000; Aravin et al.	[[124, 128]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2610	2001), and we examined whether RNAi impacts transposon silencing in Arabidopsis using a strong allele of ago1, ago1-9 (C.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2611	2002), they have strong developmental phenotypes, and they are sterile in Ler (Fagard et al.	[[74, 77]]	[]	['Ler']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2612	In ago1-9, only ATCOPIA4 was activated, accompanied by loss of H3mK9 and gain of H3mK4, but DNA methylation was unaffected (see Figure 2; data not shown).	[[63, 68]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2613	The DNA transposon AtMu1 was weakly transcribed in WT plants (Singer et al.	[[51, 53]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2614	This indicated that silencing mediated by AGO1, KYP, and CMT3 is distinct from silencing mediated by DDM1 and MET1..	[[42, 46], [57, 61], [101, 105], [48, 51]]	[]	['AGO1', 'CMT3', 'DDM1', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2615	We looked for siRNA in each of the mutants (Figure 4).	[[14, 19]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2616	Long siRNA (25 nt) is a hallmark of transposons targeted by RNAi (Llave et al.	[[60, 64], [5, 10]]	[]	['RNAi', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2617	As a control, a 21 nt microRNA (miRNA) derived from hairpin precursors (Rhoades et al.	[[32, 37]]	[]	['miRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2618	miRNA is the product of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) (At1g01040), and dcl1-9 mutants (Jacobsen et al.	[[37, 41]]	[]	['DCL1']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2619	While we could not detect siRNA corresponding to ATCOPIA4, ATLINE1-4, or ATLANTYS2, 25 nt siRNAs corresponding to AtMu1 and ATGP1, as well as the short interspersed nuclear retroelement AtSN1 (Hamilton et al.	[[26, 31], [90, 95]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2620	2002), accumulated in WT plants.	[[22, 24]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2621	These siRNAs accumulated to normal levels in sil1, kyp, and cmt3, but AtMu1 and AtSN1 were absent or nearly so in met1 and ddm1 (Figure 4; data not shown).	[[6, 11]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2622	In contrast, siRNA from the LTR and coding sequence of ATGP1 was normal in met1 and ddm1 (Figure 4; data not shown).	[[28, 31], [13, 18]]	[]	['LTR', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2623	siRNA in ago1 had the opposite pattern: transposon siRNA accumulated to normal levels except for ATGP1, which had reduced levels (Figure 4).	[[51, 56]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2624	This indicates a role for MET1 and DDM1 in siRNA accumulation and a role for siRNA in epigenetic inheritance..	[[35, 39], [43, 48], [77, 82]]	[]	['DDM1', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2625	siRNA Northern blots were hybridized with sense RNA probes for each of the transposons indicated in (A) and (B) in order to detect 25 nt antisense siRNA from each of the sequences tested.	[[147, 152]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2626	A 22 oligonucleotide size marker is indicated, and the 21 nt miRNA miR-171 was used as a loading control.	[[61, 66]]	[]	['miRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2627	Each of the mutants described here has been previously shown to impact transposon methylation, transcription, and H3mK9 accumulation (Gendrel et al.	[[114, 119]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2628	In another example, ATLANTYS2 and ATENSPM2 (as well as the defective ATCOPIA and VANDAL elements Ta2 and At4g03870) were shown to lose H3mK9 in a null allele of met1, leading to the conclusion that CG methylation is required for HMT activity (Tariq et al.	[[135, 140], [229, 232]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'HMT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2629	Here we demonstrate that, while ATLANTYS2-2, AtMu1, and ATCOPIA4 do indeed lose H3mK9 in met1-1, ATLANTYS2-1, ATLINE1-4, and ATGP1 do not lose H3mK9, despite loss of CG methylation..	[[80, 85], [143, 148]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2630	In sil1, H3mK9 is lost, but unlike in kyp, most of the elements are derepressed.	[[9, 14]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2631	SIL1 encodes the HDAC HDA6 (H.	[[17, 21]]	[]	['HDAC']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2632	(A) DDM1, MET1, and SIL1 are all required for transposon silencing and may interact.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['DDM1']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2633	MET1 and DDM1 are also required for siRNA accumulation (shown in red).	[[9, 13], [36, 41]]	[]	['DDM1', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2634	AGO and KYP have similar effects on transposon activation and may also interact.	[[8, 11]]	[]	['KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2635	They impact DNA methylation via CMT3 (Cao and Jacobsen 2002; Jackson et al.	[[32, 36]]	[]	['CMT3']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2636	(B) siRNA, histone H3 methylation, and DNA methylation interact to silence transposons.	[[4, 9]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2637	MET1, DDM1, and SIL1 may act together in a complex, accounting for loss of histone modification in met1 mutants and loss of DNA methylation in ddm1 and sil1.	[[6, 10]]	[]	['DDM1']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2638	This is also consistent with gain of H4K16 acetylation in ddm1 chromocenters (Soppe et al.	[[37, 42]]	[]	['H4K16']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2639	In contrast, KYP and AGO1 affect only a subset of transposons and may interact in a separate complex (Figure 5A).	[[21, 25], [13, 16]]	[]	['AGO1', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2640	Their effects on DNA methylation are mediated by CMT3, which utilizes H3mK9 as a guide (Cao and Jacobsen 2002; Jackson et al.	[[49, 53], [70, 75]]	[]	['CMT3', 'H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2641	The human nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex, NoRC, includes a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPase (Snf2h) as well as the RNA-binding protein TIP-5, the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1, and HDAC1 (Santoro et al.	[[50, 54], [104, 109]]	[[10, 48]]	['NoRC', 'Snf2h']	['nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex']	PMC300680.nxml
2642	pombe, ago1+ and the HMT clr4+ each effect H3mK9 as well as RNAi, indicating their products may also interact (Volpe et al.	[[43, 48], [21, 24], [60, 64]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'HMT', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2643	Although the mutants fall into separate groups, the ATCOPIA4 and ATENSPM5 transposons silenced by KYP, AGO1, and CMT3 are also silenced by DDM1.	[[103, 107], [113, 117], [98, 101]]	[]	['AGO1', 'CMT3', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2644	These complexes presumably interact with siRNA (Caudy et al.	[[41, 46]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2645	If siRNAs were shared between the two complexes, this would account for the complementary accumulation of siRNA in ago1 and met1, in that siRNAs that accumulate in met1 fail to accumulate in ago1 and vice versa (see Figure 4)..	[[3, 8], [106, 111], [138, 143]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2646	H3mK9 by KYP may depend on deacetylation by SIL1, accounting for the observation that H3mK9 depends on both complexes.	[[86, 91], [9, 12]]	[]	['H3mK9', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2647	These changes in histone modification impact CXG methylation indirectly via CMT3 (Cao and Jacobsen 2002; Jackson et al.	[[76, 80]]	[]	['CMT3']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2648	However, while both sil1 and kyp impact H3mK9, only sil1 has a major effect on transposon activation.	[[40, 45]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2649	The MET1/DDM1/SIL1 complex can maintain silencing in the absence of KYP, but KYP cannot maintain silencing in the absence of DDM1, MET1, or SIL1.	[[125, 129], [68, 71], [77, 80]]	[]	['DDM1', 'KYP', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2650	The most likely explanation is that DDM1 and MET1 influence histone modification through SIL1 (Figure 5) rather than directly via KYP, as previously proposed (Johnson et al.	[[36, 40], [130, 133]]	[]	['DDM1', 'KYP']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2651	These results implicate the gain of H3mK4, rather than the loss of H3mK9, as being important for transposon activation.	[[67, 72]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2652	It is possible, therefore, that H3mK4 is specifically excluded by DDM1 remodeling and that loss of H3mK9 in ddm1 mutants is indirect (Gendrel et al.	[[66, 70], [99, 104]]	[]	['DDM1', 'H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2653	One difference between these mutants is that met1 does not accumulate siRNA corresponding to AtSN1 or AtMu1, resembling in this respect the silencing mutants ago4 and sde4 (Hamilton et al.	[[70, 75]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2654	Loss of siRNA is not due to silencing of these transposons, as AtMu1 is activated in sil1, ddm1, and met1.	[[8, 13]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2655	In contrast, ATGP1 siRNA levels are unaffected and ATGP1 is silenced in met1/+.	[[19, 24]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2656	Further, the only elements that retained H3mK9 in met1 (ATLANTYS2-1, ATLINE1-4, and ATGP1) exhibited at least some resilencing in met1/+..	[[41, 46]]	[]	['H3mK9']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2657	Thus, MET1 may require siRNA for silencing de novo.	[[23, 28]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2658	CMT3 may also require siRNA: ATLINE1-4 was not silenced when cmt3 was backcrossed to WT, but PAI2 and SUP genes activated in cmt3 could be silenced by complementation with CMT3 transgenes (Bartee et al.	[[172, 176], [22, 27], [85, 87]]	[]	['CMT3', 'siRNA', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2659	Complementation was in the presence of an inverted repeat, which could provide siRNA in trans.	[[79, 84]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2660	We have not been able to detect siRNA from ATLINE1-4.	[[32, 37]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2661	If siRNA guides silencing by MET1, it would have to act in cis, as it is provided from the WT parent in met1/+ backcrossed plants.	[[3, 8], [91, 93]]	[]	['siRNA', 'WT']	[]	PMC300680.nxml
2662	All plants were of the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype and grown in a greenhouse under long days.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['Ler']	[]	PMC300680.nxml

2667	Mock RT–PCR was performed without reverse transcriptase using primers specific for the Cen180 repeat, which can detect trace amounts of contaminating DNA due to its high-copy number.	[[5, 11]]	[]	['RT–PCR']	[]	PMC300680.nxml

2697	The water is arranged in single file, with hydrogen bonding as donors to the projecting carbonyls from AqpZ and as donors to neighboring waters.	[[103, 107]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2698	In protomer B, four n-octyl-D-glucopyranoside (OG) molecules are positioned at the potential location of the periplasmic membrane leaflet (see Figure 1A and 1C).	[[47, 49]]	[]	['OG']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2699	In AqpZ, this selectivity filter is formed by the sidechains of F43(48), H174(191), and R189(206) and the carbonyl of T183(200) (see Figure 2A).	[[3, 7]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2700	The AQP1 selectivity filter is nearly identical, with a cysteine substituted for threonine, which is also the basis of inhibition by mercury (Preston et al.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['AQP1']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2701	Not surprisingly, AQP1 and AqpZ have similar in vitro function.	[[18, 22], [27, 31]]	[]	['AQP1', 'AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2702	In sharp contrast, GlpF contains the typical aquaglyceroporin substitutions of F43W, H199G, and T200F; the GlpF wild-type structure contains both a water and glycerol molecule bound at the selectivity filter..	[[19, 23], [107, 111]]	[]	['GlpF', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2703	The GlpF selectivity filter, larger and more hydrophobic than in AqpZ, is reminiscent of the maltoporin “greasy slide” sugar-binding sites (Dutzler et al.	[[65, 69], [4, 8]]	[]	['AqpZ', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2704	The periplasmic vestibule of GlpF also has a hydrophobic patch of residues leading into the selectivity filter, while in AqpZ the polar sidechain of N182 chemically and structurally caps off the already hydrophilic selectivity filter..	[[121, 125], [29, 33]]	[]	['AqpZ', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2705	Despite its presence at high concentration, one substrate not seen in the AqpZ structure is glycerol.	[[74, 78]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2706	This contrasts with the structure of GlpF, where ordered glycerol was located at three sites in the channel, including the NPA motif.	[[37, 41]]	[]	['GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2707	There are five well-oriented waters in the AqpZ channel, forming a chain of water nearly the length of the channel.	[[43, 47]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2708	The fifth central water molecule is a hydrogen-bond acceptor from the ND2 groups of the NPA motif asparagines (see Figure 1B and Figure 4).	[[88, 97]]	[]	['NPA motif']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2709	For water flux to occur, the central water must quickly be replaced by another, and the uniquely oriented carbonyls proximal to the NPA motif, those of F62 and V185, may reorient the NPA region water as it moves away from the center (see Figure 4).	[[132, 141]]	[]	['NPA motif']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2710	As these carbonyls are proximal to the asparagines of the NPA motif, their unique conformation may be necessary to allow water to reorient as it passes the NPA region at the quasi-2-fold axis.	[[58, 67]]	[]	['NPA motif']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2711	In AqpZ, the sidechains of L15(21) and F145(159) project into the pore and narrow it to a diameter of 3.0 Å; the GlpF diameter is 4.0 Å (see Figure 2B) and AQP1 is 3.5 Å.	[[156, 160], [3, 7], [113, 117]]	[]	['AQP1', 'AqpZ', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2712	In AqpZ, the central water located opposite the NH2 of N63(68) and N186(203) is better resolved and has a shorter hydrogen-bond distance (approximately 2.8 Å versus approximately 3.5 Å) than the corresponding water in the GlpF structure without glycerol in the cystallization buffer.	[[3, 7], [222, 226]]	[]	['AqpZ', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2713	Furthermore, with glycerol in the buffer, GlpF readily crystallizes with glycerol bound at this position.	[[42, 46]]	[]	['GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2714	This pore difference does not result from helix rearrangement, as the main chain RMSD for AqpZ and GlpF is 1.6 Å and that of AqpZ and AQP1 is 1.2 Å, but comes from sidechain variation.	[[134, 138], [90, 94], [125, 129], [99, 103], [81, 85]]	[]	['AQP1', 'AqpZ', 'AqpZ', 'GlpF', 'RMSD']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2715	In an analysis of AqpZ, we identified 15 potential bonds.	[[18, 22]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2716	With an estimated energy of 2.5–3.0 kcal/mol per bond (in vacuo), this is a partial explanation for the stability of AqpZ in denaturing conditions (Borgnia et al.	[[117, 121]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2717	Four OG detergent molecules were located bound to the periplasmic surface of each AqpZ molecule in a belt-like fashion (see Figure 1C).	[[82, 86], [5, 7]]	[]	['AqpZ', 'OG']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2718	The GlpF and AQP1 structures each contained three detergent molecules at virtually identical location on the outside surface, presumably owing to the abundance of aromatic sidechains in all three proteins at this location.	[[13, 17], [4, 8]]	[]	['AQP1', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2719	In AqpZ, there are also both acidic and basic residues interacting with the OG head group, suggesting the native lipid may be a zwitterion-like phosphatidyl ethanolamine, the most common E.	[[3, 7], [76, 78]]	[]	['AqpZ', 'OG']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2720	In AqpZ, the interface is 3,340 Å2, in large part owing to the presence of 11 aromatic residues.	[[3, 7]]	[]	['AqpZ']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2721	The GlpF and AQP1 interfaces are 3,060 Å2 and 3,180 Å2, respectively, with five and three aromatic residues, respectively.	[[13, 17], [4, 8]]	[]	['AQP1', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2722	Strikingly, the interface surface area correlates positively with biochemical stability; GlpF tends to aggregate in solution, AQP1 is well-behaved, and AqpZ is a stable tetramer in even mild denaturing conditions In this protomer–protomer interface, helices M2 and M6 form the tetramer pore..

2723	Except for a glutamate near the periplasmic opening in AQP1 and GlpF, the residues lining the pore are hydrophobic, suggesting a very large energetic barrier of translocation for any polar substrate.	[[55, 59], [64, 68]]	[]	['AQP1', 'GlpF']	[]	PMC300682.nxml
2724	AqpZ was solubilized from membranes by agitation in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 270 mM OG (Anatrace, Maumee, Ohio, United States) for 12–16 h.	[[135, 137]]	[]	['OG']	[]	PMC300682.nxml

2745	Comparisons of these 977 genes against all National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) UniGene representative sequences showed that 377 genes did not match even fragmentary ESTs and are therefore unique to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) cDNA collection (see Dataset S3).

2755	Blastocyst EST frequencies are unique even among preimplantation embryos, most likely reflecting the switch of the transcriptome from the maternal genetic program to the zygotic genetic program (Latham and Schultz 2001; Solter et al.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2756	Addition of ES and EG cells to preimplantation embryos (143 genes; Group E in Figure 3) yielded only 54 signature genes (Group F in Figure 3).	[[19, 21], [12, 14]]	[]	['EG', 'ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2757	Addition of adult stem cells, MS and NS, or MS, NS, and HS (Lin−, Kit+, Sca1+ and Lin−, Kit−, Sca1+) cells further reduced the number of signature genes to five and one, in Groups G and H, respectively (Dataset S7).

2758	Taken together, these results seem to indicate that preimplantation embryos, particularly totipotent fertilized eggs and highly pluripotent cells (ES and EG cells), have quite distinct genetic programs, but that less pluripotent adult stem cells (MS, NS, and HS) have even more specialized genetic programs.

2763	These two groups of genes may be associated with the unique feature of ES/EG cell cycle structure, where greater than 70% of the cell population are in S phase (Savatier et al.	[[74, 76]]	[]	['EG']	[]	PMC300684.nxml

2777	Interestingly, both ES cells and adult stem cells are positioned at the middle of the PC3 axis together with whole-embryo libraries from early- to mid-gestation stages (Figure 4B).	[[20, 22]]	[]	['ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2778	ES and EG cells were derived from embryos, and thus their positions matched with their developmental timing.	[[7, 9]]	[]	['EG']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2779	Although NS, MS, and HS cells were all derived from adult organs (brain, bone marrow, and bone marrow, respectively), their position along the PC3 axis corresponded to early embryonic tissues and embryo-derived stem cells (ES and EG).

2780	For example, the position of NS (differentiated) cells, a mixture of neuron and glia obtained after culturing NS cells in the differentiation conditions, was lower and nearer to the terminally differentiated cells than were NS cells.	[[29, 31], [110, 112], [224, 226]]	[]	['NS', 'NS', 'NS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2781	Osteoblast cells, which are more differentiated than the MS cells from which they are derived, were again positioned lower than the MS cells.	[[57, 59], [132, 134]]	[]	['MS', 'MS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2782	The same holds true for ES (LIF−) cells (lower PC3 position), which were obtained by culturing ES cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), allowing ES cells to differentiate into many different cell types, and ES (LIF+) cells (higher PC3 position), which were maintained as highly pluripotent by culturing them in the presence of LIF.	[[24, 26], [95, 97], [165, 167], [227, 229], [150, 153]]	[[122, 148]]	['ES', 'ES', 'ES', 'ES', 'LIF']	['leukemia inhibitory factor']	PMC300684.nxml
2783	For HS cells, all four cell types were selected first as lineage marker-negative cells, and thus they were all relatively undifferentiated cells.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['HS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2784	Finally, TS cells were positioned at the least-potent place among stem cells, which seemed to fit to their known characteristics.	[[9, 11]]	[]	['TS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2785	It has previously been shown that TS cells are already committed to the extraembryonic lineage and are less pluripotent than ES and EG cells, because TS cells injected back to mouse blastocysts only differentiate into extraembryonic trophoblast lineages (Tanaka et al.	[[132, 134], [125, 127], [34, 36], [150, 152]]	[]	['EG', 'ES', 'TS', 'TS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2786	The microarray analysis of TS cells also shows that they already express many placenta-specific genes, which is a sign of lineage-committed cells (Tanaka et al.	[[27, 29]]	[]	['TS']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2787	Finally, it is interesting to note that EG cells were positioned closely to E8.5 whole embryos and E9.5 whole embryos, whereas ES cells were positioned closely to blastocysts, E6.5, and E7.5 whole embryos (Figure 4).	[[40, 42], [127, 129]]	[]	['EG', 'ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2788	Because ES cells are derived from E3.5 blastocysts and EG cells are derived from primordial germ cells (PGCs) of E8.5 (in this particular line), these results indicate that the expression patterns of relatively abundant genes in ES and EG cells reflect their developmental stages of origin.	[[55, 57], [236, 238], [8, 10], [229, 231], [104, 107]]	[[81, 101]]	['EG', 'EG', 'ES', 'ES', 'PGC']	['primordial germ cell']	PMC300684.nxml
2789	Although ES and EG cells were established from different sources, EG cells are often considered to be ES cells and the distinction of their origin is ignored.	[[16, 18], [66, 68], [9, 11], [102, 104]]	[]	['EG', 'EG', 'ES', 'ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2790	However, the result here suggests potentially significant differences between the genetic programs of EG cells and ES cells..	[[102, 104], [115, 117]]	[]	['EG', 'ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2791	Correlation analysis combined with the FDR method (FDR = 0.1) revealed 88 genes whose expression levels were significantly associated with PC3 (Dataset S10).	[[39, 42], [51, 54]]	[]	['FDR', 'FDR']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2792	To test how well these genes represent PC3, we plotted the sum of log-transformed EST frequencies for these 88 genes versus PC3 projections of the same cell types (Figure 5).	[[82, 85]]	[]	['EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml

2798	First, approximately 1,000 putative genes that were newly identified using our cDNA collection most likely represent mouse genes unidentified previously, as they either encode ORFs greater than 100 amino acids or have multiple exons.	[[176, 179]]	[]	['ORF']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2799	These gene candidates will be a rich source of genes that are expressed at low levels, but play major roles in ES cells and adult stem cells as well as in early embryos..	[[111, 113]]	[]	['ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2800	For example, we have identified signature genes for the individual preimplantation stages, all preimplantation stages, ES cells, and adult stem cells..	[[119, 121]]	[]	['ES']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2801	Finally, the PCA of 2,812 genes with relatively abundant expression revealed 88 genes with average expression levels that correlate well to the developmental potentials of cells.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2802	Most methods for selecting differentially expressed genes from EST frequencies are based on the assumption that each cDNA clone is a random sample from the mRNA pool in the cell and hence that EST frequencies correspond to the Poisson distribution (Audic and Claverie 1997).	[[63, 66], [193, 196]]	[]	['EST', 'EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2803	Real EST libraries, however, do not satisfy this assumption because even small changes in experimental conditions may affect the stability of particular species of mRNA, which in turn will cause a bias in EST frequency.	[[5, 8], [205, 208]]	[]	['EST', 'EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2804	Because our EST libraries do not have true replications, we selected the latter approach, which yields genes that are specifically expressed in one class of tissues/stages and do not express in other tissues/stages.	[[12, 15]]	[]	['EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2805	Some cDNA clones were represented by 5′ EST, some were by 3′ EST, and some were by both 5′ EST and 3′ EST.	[[40, 43], [61, 64], [91, 94]]	[]	['EST', 'EST', 'EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2806	To avoid counting the same cDNA clone twice by 5′ EST and 3′ EST, all EST frequency analysis was done at the cDNA clone level..	[[50, 53], [61, 64], [70, 73]]	[]	['EST', 'EST', 'EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2807	Because P-values cannot be used for simultaneous assessment of multiple hypotheses, we determined significant genes using the FDR method (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995).	[[126, 129]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2808	The FDR was set to 0.1, which corresponds to the average proportion of false positives equal to 10%..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2809	As this study is focused on embryo- and stem cell–specific genes, we analyzed EST frequencies in public databases (Boguski et al.	[[78, 81]]	[]	['EST']	[]	PMC300684.nxml
2810	A total of 3,338,847 public ESTs have been grouped into the following categories: NIA Collection, Preimplantation, Embryo, Embryonic Stem Cells, Fetus, Neonate, Adult, Adult Gonad, Adult Stem Cells, Adult Tumor, and Unclassified/Pooled Tissues (Dataset S11).

2811	Of 29,810 mouse genes, 5,425 genes were not represented by ESTs, 11,574 genes were expressed predominantly in adult tissues (EST frequency in adult tissues exceeds one-third of the maximum EST frequencies in all tissues), and 12,811 were genes expressed in embryos or in gonads, tumors, and stem cells.

2837	From the blind end of the PMG primordium, germ cells start an active journey by transmigrating through midgut epithelium, moving from its apical to its basal side (Callaini et al.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2838	Once germ cells pass through the PMG, they migrate along the midgut toward the nearby mesoderm.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2839	From there, they transit from the midgut to the mesoderm, where they associate with three lateral clusters of gonadal mesoderm cells (somatic gonadal precursors [SGPs]).	[[162, 165]]	[[134, 159]]	['SGP']	['somatic gonadal precursor']	PMC300690.nxml

2846	The first step of active Drosophila germ cell migration, the migration through the PMG epithelium, has so far mostly been analyzed at the morphological level (Jaglarz and Howard 1994, 1995; Callaini et al.	[[83, 86]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2848	These observations are compatible with a passive model for germ cell transepithelial migration, in which germ cell exit is simply regulated by a change in midgut structure, or by more active models in which either mutual interactions between soma and germ line allow transgut migration or in which the expression of an attractive signal on the PMG directs germ cells through the epithelium.

2857	At stage 11, when germ cells in the wild-type have largely associated with the mesoderm, germ cells expressing EP1631 were very disorganized, and although many cells were near the SGPs, some cells migrated far past their mesodermal targets and into the ectoderm (Figure 1B and 1C).	[[180, 183]]	[]	['SGP']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2858	Overexpression of EP1631 in a number of other migratory tissues, such as gut, mesoderm, central nervous system (CNS), trachea, or crystal cells, did not affect germ cell migration, nor were significant somatic defects observed in these embryos (data not shown)..

2859	In situ hybridization analysis revealed that CG4322 GPCR mRNA is expressed in a variety of migratory cells in the embryo, such as the hemocytes, PMG, caudal visceral mesoderm, and glia (Figure 1F and 1G).	[[52, 56], [145, 148]]	[]	['GPCR', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2860	In order to rule out a maternal contribution of CG4322 to germ cell migration, we generated embryos that lacked both maternal and zygotic contribution of the CG4322 GPCR by using the OvoD/Flp technique (see Materials and Methods).	[[165, 169]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2861	The specific effect of CG4322 misexpression on germ cell migratory behavior suggested to us that GPCR signaling may be important for normal germ cell migration in Drosophila, as was recently shown for zebrafish and mouse (Doitsidou et al.	[[97, 101]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2862	However, as CG4322 mutations did not affect germ cell migration, we reasoned that other, perhaps related GPCRs may play a role in germ cells either in concert with CG4322 or on their own.	[[105, 109]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2863	To identify such a putative GPCR, we searched the Drosophila genome database for genes closely related to homologs of CG4322.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2864	CG4322 belongs to the Rhodopsin receptor class of GPCRs.	[[50, 54]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2865	The closest homologs of CG4322 in the fly genome are CG4313, the neighboring gene 2.5 kb upstream of CG4322, which has not yet been further characterized, and CG3171, which was previously thought to encode the receptor for Trehalose, tre1 (see below) (Ishimoto et al.

2883	The third GPCR gene, CG3171, however, showed clear expression in germ cells and a striking germ cell migration phenotype in mutant embryos (see below).	[[10, 14]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2884	This receptor had previously been misidentified as a receptor for Trehalose and named tre1 (Ishimoto et al.	[[86, 90]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2886	tre1 RNA is provided maternally, localized to the germ plasm, and can be detected clearly in germ cells until stage 9, when they initiate their migration through the PMG epithelium.	[[166, 169]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2887	We did not detect tre1 expression in germ cells as they coalesced into the embryonic gonads.	[[18, 22]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2888	tre1 RNA is also expressed in a variety of other tissues, including the amnioserosa, the developing CNS, the cardiac mesoderm primordium, midline glia, and (very prominently) the cuprophilic cells.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['CNS']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2889	To determine tre1 function, we studied the mutant phenotype of ΔEP5, a tre1 mutation generated by imprecise excision of the EP line EP0496 and previously reported to lack tre1 RNA (Rorth 1996; Ishimoto et al.	[[13, 17], [71, 75], [171, 175]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2890	Embryos from ΔEP5 homozygous mothers that are also zygotically mutant (M−,Z−) show no specific tre1 RNA expression until stage 9 (Figure 2F), suggesting that the ΔEP5 deletion affects the regulation of maternal and early zygotic tre1 gene expression (Ueno et al.	[[95, 99], [229, 233]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2891	Embryos derived from ΔEP5 homozygous mothers (hereafter referred as tre1 mutant embryos) are defective in the first active step of germ cell migration, the transepithelial migration though the PMG (Figure 3A–3J).	[[193, 196], [68, 72]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2892	During stage 10 of embryogenesis, wild-type germ cells migrate from the apical side of the PMG epithelium to its basal side.	[[91, 94]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2893	In contrast, most germ cells in tre1 mutant embryos do not transmigrate the PMG, but remain clumped together within the midgut pocket (Figure 3A and 3B).	[[76, 79], [32, 36]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2894	While in wild-type embryos, germ cells migrate away from the gut during stage 11, associate with gonadal mesoderm, and eventually form two bilateral gonads, germ cells remained within the gut throughout development in tre1 mutants (see Figure 3C–3F; Figure S1A–S1D and S1I–S1J).	[[218, 222]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2895	At the end of embryogenesis, tre1 mutant embryos have on average one to two germ cells in either gonad, compared to about 12–15 germ cells per gonad in wild-type (see Figure 3E and 3F; see also Figure 7E and 7F).	[[29, 33]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2905	To determine whether the germ cell migration defect observed in tre1 mutants was due to a developmental defect in any of the somatic tissues known to be required for normal germ cell migration, we analyzed the expression of midgut and mesodermal markers in the mutants.	[[64, 68]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2906	We conclude that the transepithelial migration defect in tre1 embryos is most probably not due to a secondary effect resulting from defects in the specification or morphogenesis of tissues lining the migratory pathway.	[[57, 61]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2907	Together with the expression pattern of tre1 RNA in germ cells, these results suggest that tre1 acts directly in the migrating germ cells..	[[40, 44], [91, 95]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2908	The tre1 gene is located in polytene band 5A10 on the X chromosome and, as mentioned above, was initially identified as a GPCR thought to act as a taste receptor for Trehalose.	[[122, 126], [4, 8]]	[]	['GPCR', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2909	Subsequently, however, a second GPCR, Gr5a, which maps adjacent to tre1, was shown to be the actual receptor of Trehalose, leaving the function of tre1 and the nature of its ligand unknown (Ishimoto et al.	[[32, 36], [67, 71], [147, 151]]	[]	['GPCR', 'tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2910	The predicted transcription start sites of tre1 and Gr5a are about 900 basepairs apart (Figure 4A).	[[43, 47]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2911	The deletion mutant ΔEP5 extends from the first exon of tre1 to the start of the Gr5a transcription unit.	[[56, 60]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2912	ΔEP5 homozygous mutants are adult viable and were reported to lack both tre1 and Gr5a transcripts (Ueno et al.	[[72, 76]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2913	To confirm that indeed loss of tre1 and not loss of Gr5a gene function was responsible for the observed germ cell migration defect, we introduced into the deletion mutant genomic rescue constructs that contained a 10-kb genomic region, which covers both tre1 and Gr5a (Dahanukar et al.	[[31, 35], [254, 258]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2914	In addition to the transgene that is wild-type for both genes (T+ G+), we tested two other transgenes, T− G+ and T+ G− that carry a stop codon mutation near the N-terminus of tre1 or Gr5a, respectively, and therefore supply a functional gene product for only one of the two genes (see Materials and Methods).

2915	The wild-type construct for both genes (T+ G+) and the construct carrying the wild-type copy for tre1 (T+ G−) rescued completely the migration phenotype of embryos from ΔEP5 homozygous mothers (Figure 4C and 4E).	[[97, 101]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2916	In contrast, embryos from ΔEP5 mothers carrying a nonfunctional copy of the tre1 gene (T− G+) produced a strong migration phenotype, demonstrating that indeed tre1, and not Gr5a, is required for the migration of germ cells through the PMG (Figure 4D)..

2928	In addition to the tre1 null allele, ΔEP5, we analyzed two additional mutations that alter tre1 function (Figure 4F–4J).	[[19, 23], [91, 95]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2929	As described above, ΔEP5 is the strongest allele and its phenotype likely resembles the tre1 null phenotype.	[[88, 92]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2930	The P-element excision mutant ΔEP19 partially deletes the putative promoter region of tre1 and the promoter and the first exon of Gr5a (Figure 4A) (Dahanukar et al.	[[86, 90]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2931	2001), but still transcribes some tre1 RNA (data not shown).	[[34, 38]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2932	Finally, we found that the scattershot (sctt) mutation, which was isolated recently in a mutagenesis screen for X-chromosomal mutants with germ cell migration defects and was mapped to the same chromosomal region as tre1 (Coffman et al.	[[40, 44], [216, 220]]	[[27, 38]]	['sctt', 'tre1']	['scattershot']	PMC300690.nxml
2933	In sctt mutants, the majority of germ cells remain in the gut; however, they seem less “clumped” compared to the strong ΔEP5 phenotype and more germ cells migrate correctly to the gonad (Figure 4F–4H).	[[3, 7]]	[]	['sctt']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2934	The phenotype of sctt mutants is enhanced in trans to ΔEP5, suggesting that it is a partial loss-of-function mutation (Figure 4I; see Materials and Methods)..	[[17, 21]]	[]	['sctt']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2935	The tre1 phenotype is observed in the progeny of homozygous mutant mothers.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2936	To test for a zygotic requirement of tre1, we crossed embryos laid by ΔEP5 homozygous mothers with wild-type males (M− Z+ embryos).	[[37, 41]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2937	This observation is consistent with tre1 RNA expression: while embryos from ΔEP5 homozygous mothers crossed to wild-type males (M− Z+) lack maternal germ plasm, early germ cell, and cellular blastoderm expression, tre1 RNA is expressed zygotically at low levels throughout the embryos, starting at stage 8/9, and is consistently seen in germ cells (see Figure 2G).	[[36, 40], [214, 218]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2938	Embryos only lacking zygotic tre1 function (M+ Z−) have no germ cell migration defect (data not shown).	[[29, 33]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2939	Thus, tre1 has a maternal and zygotic component required for germ cell migration.	[[6, 10]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2940	The maternal component of tre1 is critical for normal germ cell migration, while the zygotic component of tre1 function is dispensable.	[[26, 30], [106, 110]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2941	The partial zygotic rescue of the maternal phenotype further suggests that zygotic tre1 RNA transcription in germ cells may contribute to the ability of germ cells to migrate through the midgut epithelium..	[[83, 87]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2942	tre1 mutants affect germ cell migration maternally, and tre1 RNA is present in early germ cells; we therefore hypothesized that tre1 may act specifically in germ cells to mediate their migration through the PMG.	[[56, 60], [128, 132]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2943	We used two experimental approaches to test whether tre1 is required in the germ cells in a cell-autonomous manner.	[[52, 56]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2944	In the first approach, germ cells from wild-type or tre1 mutant females were transplanted into tudor embryos (embryos produced by homozygous tudor mothers that lack germ cells) (Boswell and Mahowald 1985; Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard 1986, 1987).	[[52, 56]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2945	In contrast, tre1 germ cells transplanted into tudor embryos rarely migrated to the gonad.	[[13, 17]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2946	Only 11% of embryos had transplanted tre1 germ cells in the gonad (n = 38) (Figure 5C–5D and 5G–5H), and only 9.1% of all transplanted germ cells successfully migrated to the gonad (n = 87).	[[37, 41]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2947	To test for a somatic role of tre1, we transplanted wild-type germ cells into tre1 mutant embryos.	[[30, 34], [78, 82]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2948	These experiments suggest that tre1 function is required within the germ cells for their normal migration..	[[31, 35]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2955	Since the tre1 gene is located on the X chromosome, only half of the embryos are expected to carry a copy of EP0496 and should thus express the tre1 gene in the germ cells.	[[10, 14], [144, 148]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2956	Embryos derived from crossing a UAS-LacZ line to ΔEP5 mothers carrying nos-GAL4 showed only the minor zygotic rescue of the mutant phenotype as described above (data not shown).	[[32, 35]]	[]	['UAS']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2957	A difficulty in the interpretation of this experiment lies in the fact that the nos-GAL4 driver also transiently activates somatic expression in the PMG anlage at the blastoderm stage (Van Doren et al.	[[149, 152]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2958	Thus, the phenotypic rescue could be due to expression of tre1 in the PMG during the blastoderm stage rather than due to germ cell expression.	[[70, 73], [58, 62]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2959	To rule out this possibility, we wanted to express tre1 in the PMG anlage at the blastoderm stage.	[[63, 66], [51, 55]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2960	Since there are no early GAL4 drivers available that specifically express a reporter in the PMG anlage, we used a somatic driver, nullo-GAL4, which efficiently drives expression in all somatic tissues, including the PMG, during the blastoderm stage, but does not activate transcription in the germ cells (Figure 6C) (W.	[[92, 95], [216, 219]]	[]	['PMG', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2961	We did not observe any rescue of the tre1 phenotype with this driver (Figure 6D; total number of embryos analyzed, n = 200).	[[37, 41]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2962	These experiments demonstrate that tre1 is required autonomously in germ cells for their migration through the PMG and that transcription of tre1 in early germ cells is sufficient to rescue the migration phenotype..

2963	EP(X)0496, which drives expression of tre1 RNA, was expressed either in the germline by the germline-specific driver nos-GAL4 (A) or in the soma by somatic blastoderm cell-specific driver nullo-GAL4 (C).	[[38, 42]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2966	Migration through the PMG is thought to be the first stage at which germ cells are actively migrating; thus, a failure to pass through the PMG might be due to a failure to respond to a specific guidance signal.	[[22, 25], [139, 142]]	[]	['PMG', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2967	Alternatively, since the germ cells are passively carried into the blind pocket of the PMG during gastrulation movements, the step of transepithelial migration would be the first step to be affected if germ cells were immotile.	[[87, 90]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2968	To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the tre1 phenotype more carefully.	[[64, 68]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2969	We observed that while most germ cells do not leave the midgut, in tre1 mutant embryos, a few germ cells are consistently found in the gonad in most embryos (Figure 7A–7F), indicating that tre1 germ cells were motile and were able to follow guidance signals to reach the embryonic gonad.	[[67, 71], [189, 193]]	[]	['tre1', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2970	Careful counting showed that the number of tre1 germ cells that had passed through the PMG anlage at the blastoderm stage, prior to midgut pocket formation (1.27 germ cells per embryo, n = 50), correlated with the number of germ cells on the basal side of the PMG at stage 10 (1.47 germ cells per embryo, n = 50) and the number of germ cells in the gonad at stage 13 (1.2 germ cells per embryo, n = 50).	[[87, 90], [260, 263], [43, 47]]	[]	['PMG', 'PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2971	This indicates that germ cells that migrated to the gonad in tre1 embryos might have originally crossed the PMG anlage prior to midgut specification and may thus not require a Tre1-mediated signal.	[[108, 111], [61, 65]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2972	Second, the majority of germ cells that pass through the blastoderm prior to PMG specification seem to migrate correctly to the gonad, which would not be expected if passing through the blastoderm were the consequence of a partially penetrant migration phenotype.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2973	This suggests that tre1 germ cells are defective in a migratory step that allows them to pass through the PMG epithelium, but that they are otherwise motile and able to respond to other guidance signals to reach the gonad..	[[106, 109], [19, 23]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2974	Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Rho1, Rho1N19, in germ cells caused many of them to remain inside the PMG of stage 10 embryos, closely resembling the phenotype observed in tre1 mutant embryos (Figure 8E) (Barrett et al.	[[116, 119], [186, 190]]	[]	['PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2975	RhoV14-expressing germ cells successfully transmigrated the PMG during stages 9 and 10 of embryogenesis, but subsequently some germ cells failed to move from the PMG into the mesoderm (Figure 8C) (Lee et al.	[[60, 63], [162, 165]]	[]	['PMG', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2976	As a consequence, these germ cells also remained associated with the PMG (Figure 8D).	[[69, 72]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2977	The fact that a dominant-negative form of Rho1 caused a similar migration defect as that observed in tre1 mutant embryos and that expression of other GTPases either showed no or a different migration defect strongly suggest that Tre1-dependent transepithelial migration is mediated by Rho GTPase in germ cells..

2981	We have identified a novel Drosophila GPCR, Tre1, that is required for transepithelial migration of germ cells through the PMG epithelium.	[[38, 42], [123, 126]]	[]	['GPCR', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2982	tre1 RNA is expressed in germ cells, and tre1 acts cell autonomously in germ cells.	[[41, 45]]	[]	['tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2983	Transmigration of germ cells through the PMG epithelium is the first active stage of germ cell migration, and specific mutations had previously not been identified for this step.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2984	Tre1 GPCR function specifically affects this stage, as “pioneer” tre1 germ cells that bypass the requirement for transepithelial migration through the PMG are motile and can follow other, later-acting migratory cues.	[[5, 9], [151, 154], [65, 69]]	[]	['GPCR', 'PMG', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2985	These results suggest that GPCRs play an important role in transepithelial migration of germ cells and lead us to speculate that Tre1 might function in a manner equivalent to the chemokine receptors required for transepithelial migration of leukocytes..	[[27, 31]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2986	Previous models for transgut migration of germ cells relied on the study of wild-type germ cell migration and analysis of mutants that affect PMG specification (Jaglarz and Howard 1994, 1995; Callaini et al.	[[142, 145]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2987	Most of these observations—including the fact that the midgut epithelium reorganizes independently of germ cells, that genes that disrupt PMG specification block germ cell transgut migration, and that either retarded or precocious germ cells would transmigrate the gut in accord with gut morphology—were compatible with a passive model.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2988	In contrast, our analysis of tre1 gene function demonstrates that the Tre1 GPCR acts in germ cells to specifically promote transepithelial migration.	[[75, 79], [29, 33]]	[]	['GPCR', 'tre1']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2989	One possibility is that Tre1 mediates the initial interactions between germ cells and PMG cells, which may facilitate the passage of germ cells.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2990	The gonadal mesoderm produces an attractant mediated by the HMG-CoAR (hmgcr/clb) pathway to attract germ cells to the mesoderm, while the PMG produces a repellent signal produced by lipid phosphatase (wunen and wunen2) (for a review of migration steps, see Figure 1A).	[[60, 68], [138, 141]]	[]	['HMG-CoAR', 'PMG']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

2992	While it may be tempting to speculate that Tre1 could respond to signals produced by Clb/HMG-CoAR, Wunen, or both, this seems unlikely since germ cells can migrate successfully out of the PMG in these mutants and tre1 “pioneer” germ cells can migrate successfully to the gonad.

2996	Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that this new group of GPCRs might be required for a variety of migratory functions, including transepithelial migration.	[[80, 84]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml
2997	It will be interesting to see whether these GPCRs also play an important role in germ cell development in other organisms..	[[44, 48]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

3006	Interestingly, a few mammalian GPCRs in the Rhodopsin class mediate a response by directly associating with monomeric GTPases, such as Rho1 and ARF, which are involved in the regulation of endocytosis and phagocytosis (Mitchell et al.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['GPCR']	[]	PMC300690.nxml

3051	Tumor development in VHL disease is linked to somatic inactivation or loss of the remaining wild-type VHL allele, leading to loss of the wild-type VHL gene product, pVHL.	[[21, 24], [102, 105], [147, 150]]	[]	['VHL', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml

3053	Conversely, restoration of pVHL function is sufficient to suppress tumor formation by pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells in vivo (Iliopoulos et al.	[[27, 31], [86, 90]]	[]	['pVHL', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml

3055	Enzymatic hydroxylation of conserved prolyl residues within these proteins by members of the egg-laying-defective nine (EGLN) family is required for their recognition by pVHL (Kaelin 2002).	[[120, 124], [170, 174]]	[[93, 118]]	['EGLN', 'pVHL']	['egg-laying-defective nine']	PMC300692.nxml
3056	In contrast, cells lacking wild-type pVHL fail to degrade HIFα subunits in the presence of oxygen, and thus hypoxia-inducible gene products are constitutively overproduced.	[[37, 41]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3057	Among these proteins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor B, implicated in angiogenesis; phosphoglycerate kinase and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), involved in glucose uptake and metabolism; and transforming growth factor α (TGFα), which can establish a mitogenic autocrine loop with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) (Iliopoulos et al.

3058	Tumor-derived pVHL mutants are typically defective with respect to HIF polyubiquitination in vivo, and the HIF target genes cited above are implicated in tumorigenesis.	[[67, 70], [107, 110], [14, 18]]	[]	['HIF', 'HIF', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3059	Thus, correlative data and biological plausibility support a role for HIF in pVHL-defective tumor formation.	[[70, 73], [77, 81]]	[]	['HIF', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3060	Nonetheless, emerging genotype–phenotype correlations in VHL disease suggest that pVHL has multiple functions.	[[82, 86], [57, 60]]	[]	['pVHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3061	For example, pVHL mutants associated with a low risk (type 2A VHL disease) and high risk (type 2B disease) of renal cell carcinoma are similarly defective with respect to HIF regulation (Clifford et al.	[[171, 174], [13, 17], [62, 65]]	[]	['HIF', 'pVHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3062	Interestingly, individuals with Chuvash polycythemia are homozygous for a hypomorphic VHL allele that is quantitatively defective with respect to HIF regulation, which leads to overproduction of erythropoietin in vivo but not tumor formation (Ang et al.	[[146, 149], [86, 89]]	[]	['HIF', 'VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3063	Moreover, forced activation of HIF target genes has not led to tumor formation in the animal models tested so far (Vincent et al.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3064	Conversely, some pVHL mutants that retain the ability to regulate HIF are linked to familial pheochromocytoma (type 2C VHL disease) (Clifford et al.	[[66, 69], [17, 21], [119, 122]]	[]	['HIF', 'pVHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3065	Collectively, these findings suggest that tumor formation following pVHL inactivation reflects the loss of multiple pVHL functions in a context-dependent manner..	[[68, 72], [116, 120]]	[]	['pVHL', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3066	In this report we provide data that strengthen our earlier conclusion that inhibition of HIF2α is necessary for pVHL-dependent suppression of renal carcinoma tumor formation in vivo (Kondo et al.	[[112, 116]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3067	Collectively, these results indicate that HIF2α is a critical downstream target of pVHL with respect to suppression of renal carcinogenesis..	[[83, 87]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3068	Hydroxylation of HIF1α Pro564 or HIF2α Pro531 generates a pVHL-binding site (Ivan et al.	[[58, 62]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3069	We previously showed that a HIF2α variant in which Pro531 was replaced by alanine (HIF2α P531A) escaped recognition by pVHL and induced the expression of HIF target genes in vivo (Kondo et al.	[[154, 157], [119, 123]]	[]	['HIF', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3070	Moreover, HIF2α P531A abrogated pVHL-dependent tumor suppression in vivo, implying that HIF is functionally downstream of pVHL and that inhibition of HIF is necessary for tumor suppression by pVHL (Kondo et al.	[[88, 91], [150, 153], [32, 36], [122, 126], [192, 196]]	[]	['HIF', 'HIF', 'pVHL', 'pVHL', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3071	Shortly thereafter, it was shown that hydroxylation of HIF1α Pro404 (corresponding to HIF2α Pro405) creates a second potential pVHL-binding site within HIF1α (Masson et al.	[[127, 131]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3072	Although we could not detect a physical interaction between pVHL and HIF2α P531A (Kondo et al.	[[60, 64]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3073	2002), the identification of a second potential pVHL-binding site left open the possibility that the biological effects of HIF2α P531A were due, at least partly, to perturbation of pVHL function as a result of direct binding.	[[48, 52], [181, 185]]	[]	['pVHL', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3074	The latter contains a five amino acid substitution within the HIF2α basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) domain that leads to loss of DNA-binding capability (Kondo et al.	[[92, 96]]	[[68, 90]]	['bHLH']	['basic helix–loop–helix']	PMC300692.nxml
3075	786-O renal carcinoma cells lack wild-type pVHL and overproduce HIF2α (Iliopoulos et al.	[[43, 47]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3076	Reintroduction of wild-type pVHL into 786-O cells by stable transfection does not affect cell growth in vitro under standard serum-rich growth conditions, but leads to downregulation of HIF2α protein levels, suppression of hypoxia-inducible gene expression, and impaired tumorigenesis in vivo (Iliopoulos et al.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml

[[261, 265], [63, 67]]	[]	['bHLH', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3080	These results, together with our earlier findings, indicate that inhibition of HIF2α is necessary for tumor suppression by pVHL..	[[123, 127]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3081	To ask whether inhibition of HIF2α is likewise sufficient for tumor suppression by pVHL, we set out to inhibit HIF2α in VHL(−/−) renal carcinoma cells using short hairpin RNAs (shRNA).	[[83, 87], [177, 182]]	[]	['pVHL', 'shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3082	We tested five HIF2α shRNAs based on 19mer sequences that are unique to HIF2α according to GenBank.	[[21, 26]]	[]	['shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3083	Two such shRNAs (#2 and #3) decreased HIF2α protein levels, as determined by anti-HIF2α immunoblot analysis and by diminished activity of a cotransfected HRE–luciferase reporter plasmid, when transiently introduced into 786-O cells (data not shown).	[[9, 14]]	[]	['shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3084	Infection of 786-O cells with retroviruses encoding shRNA #2 or #3, but not the parental retrovirus, led to decreased steady-state levels of HIF2α protein as well as decreased levels of GLUT1, which is encoded by a HIF-responsive gene (Figure 2A).	[[186, 191], [215, 218], [52, 57]]	[]	['GLUT1', 'HIF', 'shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3085	The former observation is consistent with the finding that pVHL does not inhibit cell proliferation under standard cell culture conditions and argues against the idea that the latter was due to nonspecific toxicity.	[[59, 63]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3086	Moreover, these in vivo effects could be prevented by coadministration of a retrovirus encoding an HIF2α mRNA with silent third-base mutations within the shRNA recognition site (Figure 3) and were not observed with retroviruses encoding a scrambled HIF2α shRNA or luciferase shRNA (data not shown).

3094	Tumor formation by these cells in nude mice is diminished following restoration of pVHL function (Lonergan et al.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3095	In keeping with the results obtained with 786-O cells, downmodulation of HIF2α levels with shRNA did not affect A498 cell growth in vitro (data not shown), but dramatically inhibited tumor growth in vivo (Figure 4A).	[[91, 96]]	[]	['shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3096	It will be important in the future to ask whether disruption of HIF2α is sufficient to suppress tumor formation by pVHL-defective cells that produce both HIFα paralogs.	[[115, 119]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3097	In this regard, studies of renal precursor lesions in VHL patients suggest that HIF2α is more oncogenic than HIF1α (Mandriota et al.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3098	It is tempting to speculate that loss of HIF1α expression in some pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells confers a selective advantage in vivo, perhaps related to the ability of HIF1α to induce apoptosis in some settings (Carmeliet et al.	[[66, 70]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3099	Interestingly, the small A498 tumors that did form in the presence of HIF2α shRNA consisted of malignant cells forming tubulopapillary structures, corresponding to papillary (chromophil) renal carcinoma histology, whereas the empty vector tumors consisted primarily of sheets of clear cells, as would be seen in typical clear-cell renal carcinoma, with interspersed areas displaying papillary features (Figure 4B).	[[76, 81]]	[]	['shRNA']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3100	This suggests that dysregulation of HIF2α is causally linked to the clear-cell pattern and is consistent with the tight linkage between VHL mutations and this renal carcinoma subtype..	[[136, 139]]	[]	['VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3101	Most of the work performed so far with respect to the oncogenic effects of HIF has focused exclusively on HIF1α, where both prooncogenic and antioncogenic effects have been reported (Maxwell et al.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3102	Likewise, loss of pVHL is prooncogenic in a restricted subset of human tissues (Kaelin 2002).	[[18, 22]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3103	In the mouse, loss of pVHL promotes hemangioma development in the liver, but inhibits tumor formation by embryonic stem cells (Haase et al.	[[22, 26]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3104	Loss of pVHL in the human kidney gives rise to premaligant renal cysts (Zhuang et al.	[[8, 12]]	[]	['pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3105	It is presumed that additional mutations at non-VHL loci are required for conversion to frank renal cell carcinomas.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['VHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3106	It will therefore be of interest to determine whether dysregulation of HIF is sufficient to produce renal cysts.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3107	In this regard, TGFα, which is encoded by a HIF target gene, is a potent renal mitogen and is sufficient to induce renal cysts in the mouse (Lowden et al.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3108	On the other hand, our data do not exclude the possibility that the development of renal pathology following pVHL loss in humans reflects a complex interplay between dysregulated HIF2α and loss of a second pVHL function.	[[109, 113], [206, 210]]	[]	['pVHL', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3109	pVHL has been implicated in control of cell-cycle, differentiation, and extracellular matrix formation, although the extent to which these activities are due to control of HIF is not known (Kaelin 2002).	[[172, 175]]	[]	['HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3110	A number of non-HIF pVHL-binding partners have, however, been reported, including atypical protein kinase C members, VDU1, SP1, and fibronectin (Kaelin 2002)..	[[16, 19], [20, 24]]	[]	['HIF', 'pVHL']	[]	PMC300692.nxml

3112	Among the known HIF targets, the abovementioned TGFα and its cognate receptor, EGFR, are frequently overproduced in renal carcinoma and are suspected to establish an autocrine loop (Mydlo et al.	[[79, 83], [16, 19]]	[]	['EGFR', 'HIF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3113	A number of EGFR are presently in clinical trials (Fabbro et al.	[[12, 16]]	[]	['EGFR']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3114	Likewise, overproduction of VEGF is common in renal cell carcinoma and likely contributes to tumor angiogenesis in this setting (Walke et al.	[[29, 32], [28, 32]]	[]	['EGF', 'VEGF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml
3115	Drugs directed against VEGF or its receptors are also being tested in humans (Fabbro et al.	[[24, 27], [23, 27]]	[]	['EGF', 'VEGF']	[]	PMC300692.nxml

3158	Overall, these results show that C57BL/6ByJ BMMs have dramatically lower amounts of functional IRF3 protein, and in conjunction with the existing Irf3 knock-out data [2,4], explain the increased resistance of C57BL/6ByJ mice to L.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['BMM']	[]	PMC1971118.nxml

3164	Therefore, transfection of intron 5–containing Irf3 mRNAs into BMMs that lack Irf3 should lead to a level of Ifnb1 induction that is proportional to the splicing efficiency of intron 5.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['BMM']	[]	PMC1971118.nxml

3194	Since Rpd3, encoding an HDAC, was identified as one of the genes which, when mutated, exhibited both genetic and epigenetic enhancement of hopTum-l tumorigenicity (Table 1), we reasoned that the epigenetic effect of an Rpd3 mutation on hopTum-l tumorigenicity might be mimicked by HDAC inhibitors such as tricostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate.

3195	Indeed, TSA treatment caused increased levels of acetylated histone H3 (Figure 1E), and increased the tumor index of hopTum-l/+ flies from 0.38 to 0.96 ± 0.06 (p < 0.01).	[[8, 11]]	[]	['TSA']	[]	PMC1971119.nxml
3196	Consistent with a transgenerational epigenetic effect, when wild-type flies that had been treated with TSA were mated with untreated hopTum-l/+ females and the progeny were raised in the absence of the drug, the TI of hopTum-l/+ F1 progeny was also significantly increased (Figure 1F).

3197	As with Kr1, no epigenetic effect was found in the reciprocal cross (Figure 1F), suggesting that the presence of hopTum-l in the early embryo is important for TSA treatment to have a transgenerational epigenetic effect on hopTum-l tumorigenicity.	[[159, 162]]	[]	['TSA']	[]	PMC1971119.nxml
3198	A similar transgenerational epigenetic effect on hopTum-l tumorigenicity was also found with another HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate (unpublished data)..	[[104, 105], [101, 105]]	[]	['C', 'HDAC']	[]	PMC1971119.nxml

3208	Finally, to further demonstrate the differential methylation of the ftz minimal enhancer in different genetic backgrounds or pedigrees, we treated the genomic DNA samples with sodium bisulfite, which converts cytosines (C) to thymidines (T), and then cloned and sequenced independent clones for each sample.

3213	When raised at 100 μM 5-aza-dC (a nonlethal dose), hopTum-l/+ flies exhibited dramatically increased tumors compared with untreated hopTum-l/+ flies, with TI increased from 0.41 ± 0.05 (untreated; n = 116) to 1.27 ± 0.15 (treated; n = 68; p < 0.001).

3215	Similar to the effects of TSA treatment, when wild-type male flies raised in 5-aza-dC were crossed to hopTum-l/+ females and allowed to produce eggs in the absence of the drug, the F1 flies exhibited increased TIs (Figure 5), but no TI increase was detected in the reciprocal cross (unpublished data), suggesting a maternal hopTum-l-dependent transgenerational inheritance.

3216	Interestingly, we found that treatment with 5-aza-dC, although by itself promotes hopTum-l tumorigenesis, abolished the ability of Kr mutations to epigenetically enhance tumors, such that when Kr1/CyO male flies raised on 5-aza-dC food were crossed to hopTum-l/+ females, the epigenetic effects (associated with CyO), but not the genetic effects of Kr, were abolished (Figure 5).

3370	HLA-DRB1*08 increases risk significantly with HLA-DRB1*15 in trans.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3371	Thus, HLA-DRB1*08 shows a synergistic mode of inheritance with HLA-DRB1*15.	[[6, 9], [63, 66]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3372	HLA-DRB1*17 shows no interaction with HLA-DRB1*08 (unpublished data), further highlighting the difference between HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DRB1*17 haplotypes..	[[38, 41], [114, 117], [130, 133]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3373	As yet, no molecular or functional explanation can be given for the dominant-negative effects of HLA-DRB1*14 and DRB1*11, the complementary effects of HLA-DRB1*08, and the protective nature of HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*10 in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15.	[[97, 100], [151, 154], [193, 196], [236, 239]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA', 'HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3374	It has been speculated that poor engagement of the encephalitogenic peptide in the context of HLA-DRB1*14 acts to alter the immune response in a dominant-negative manner and thereby reduce the effect of HLA-DRB1*15 [13].	[[94, 97], [203, 206]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3375	Another explanation is that HLA-DRB1*14 binds one or more peptides that can delete autoreactive T cells.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3376	Alternatively, other risk factors present on HLA-DRB1 haplotypes could be interacting in cis and trans to reduce MS risk.	[[45, 48], [113, 115]]	[]	['HLA', 'MS']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3377	HLA-DRB1 allelic association with MS susceptibility and resistance may reflect linkage disequilibrium with the true disease locus/loci.	[[34, 36]]	[]	['MS']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3378	The identity and location of these putative variants are unknown and will be difficult to identify given the high linkage disequilibrium present within the MHC, although it is likely that these variants, if they exist, will be found in the class II region [16,22].	[[156, 159]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3379	Susceptibility and resistance haplotypes may need revisiting if/when true or additional MS MHC susceptibility loci are uncovered.	[[91, 94], [88, 90]]	[]	['MHC', 'MS']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3380	As mentioned previously [10], HLA-DRB1*14, DRB1*10, and DRB1*01 share the extended HLA-DQ haplotype HLA-DQA1*01-DQB1*05, which may protect against MS.	[[30, 33], [83, 86], [100, 103]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3381	However, HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes do not share these HLA-DQ alleles.	[[9, 12], [51, 54]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3382	Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis suggests that HLA-DRB1*10 and DRB1*01 share the same allelic lineage (DR1 group) and HLA-DRB1*11, DRB1*14, and DRB1*12 belong to the DR52 group [23].	[[51, 54], [122, 125]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3383	Variants on the similar HLA-DRB1*10 and DRB1*01 haplotypes could enable them to be protective in the presence of HLA-DRB1*15.	[[24, 27], [113, 116]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3384	It has been shown that low immune responsiveness to certain antigens are HLA-linked dominant traits [24]; this was proposed to be caused by an immune suppression gene present on certain HLA haplotypes that controls the generation of antigen-specific suppressor T cells [25].	[[73, 76], [186, 189]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3385	Recently, HLA-DRB5*0101 has been shown to reduce the number of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models [26].	[[10, 13]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3386	It is conceivable that dominant variants on HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes can generate T cells that suppress autoreactive T cells, even those generated by HLA-DRB1*15..	[[44, 47], [60, 63], [164, 167]]	[]	['HLA', 'HLA', 'HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3387	This study highlights the need for a large sample size and systematic methods of analysis (e.g., stratified TDT is a more sensitive measure to detect interactions between alleles than regression) in order to unravel the complexity of HLA associations.	[[234, 237], [108, 111]]	[]	['HLA', 'TDT']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3388	Further studies of HLA expression, and/or animal models incorporating the susceptibility and resistance genotypes, are warranted to explain these complex interactions.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3389	All participants in the study were ascertained through the ongoing CCPGSMS, for which the methodology has been previously described [27]..	[[67, 74], [72, 74]]	[]	['CCPGSMS', 'MS']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3390	Total genomic DNA, extracted from whole blood as part of the CCPGSMS, was used to type HLA-DRB1 alleles by an allele-specific PCR amplification method [28].	[[61, 68], [87, 90], [66, 68]]	[]	['CCPGSMS', 'HLA', 'MS']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3391	Either 24 (low resolution) or 72 (high resolution) PCRs were carried out to amplify allelotypes corresponding to alleles HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-DRB1*04, HLA-DRB1*07, HLA-DRB1*08, HLA-DRB1*09, HLA-DRB1*10, HLA-DRB1*11, HLA-DRB1*12, HLA-DRB1*13, HLA-DRB1*14, HLA-DRB1*15, HLA-DRB1*16, HLA-DRB1*17, and HLA-DRB1*18, as well as products for the DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5 genes.

3394	For TDTs the χ2 distribution was used to assess significance, except in TDTs where the sum of transmissions and non-transmissions was less than 50, when the exact binomial test was used.	[[4, 7], [72, 75]]	[]	['TDT', 'TDT']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3395	Association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with MS was assessed by conditional logistic regression with each MS case matched to pseudo-controls, formed from the possible offspring that could have occurred from the parental mating [29].

3396	Association of HLA-DRB1 alleles was then assessed by stepwise model selection, with allelic effects added or removed at each stage if p < 0.05.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml
3397	To allow for correlations between multiple affected offspring from the same family, cases and matched pseudo-controls were clustered by pedigree and robust Huber-White estimators used to adjust the standard errors of ORs [30]..	[[217, 219]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC1971120.nxml

3399	Conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3400	Some CNCs have been shown to act as cis-regulatory modules, but the function of most CNCs remains unclear.	[[5, 8], [85, 88]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3401	To study the evolution of CNCs, we have developed a statistical method called the “shared rates test” to identify CNCs that show significant variation in substitution rates across branches of a phylogenetic tree.	[[26, 29], [114, 117]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3402	We report an application of this method to alignments of 98,910 CNCs from the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, and rat genomes.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3403	We find that ∼68% of CNCs evolve according to a null model where, for each CNC, a single parameter models the level of constraint acting throughout the phylogeny linking these five species.	[[21, 24], [75, 78]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3404	The remaining ∼32% of CNCs show departures from the basic model including speed-ups and slow-downs on particular branches and occasionally multiple rate changes on different branches.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3405	We find that a subset of the significant CNCs have evolved significantly faster than the local neutral rate on a particular branch, providing strong evidence for adaptive evolution in these CNCs.	[[41, 44], [190, 193]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3406	The distribution of these signals on the phylogeny suggests that adaptive evolution of CNCs occurs in occasional short bursts of evolution.	[[87, 90]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3407	Recent studies have found that there are many thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) in vertebrate genomes and have suggested possible functions for some of these elements, but the function of most CNCs remains unknown.	[[89, 92], [208, 211]]	[[59, 86]]	['CNC', 'CNC']	['conserved noncoding element']	PMC1971121.nxml
3408	To study the evolution of CNCs, we developed a statistical method to identify CNCs that show changes in evolutionary rates on particular branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree.	[[26, 29], [78, 81]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3409	We applied our method to CNCs of five mammalian genomes, and found that, indeed, many CNCs have experienced rate changes during their evolution.	[[25, 28], [86, 89]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3410	We also found a subset of CNCs showing accelerations in evolutionary rate that actually exceed the neutral rates, suggesting that adaptive evolution has shaped the evolution of those elements..	[[26, 29]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3411	One possible way forward is to study the evolution of conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) [5–7].	[[84, 87]]	[[54, 81]]	['CNC']	['conserved noncoding element']	PMC1971121.nxml
3412	Some CNCs show extremely high levels of conservation; for example, Bejerano et al.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3413	Recent studies of CNCs, using varied definitions, have reported that most CNCs are segments of around 100–300 bp, and that they are widely distributed across the human genome [9,10,14–18].	[[18, 21], [74, 77]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3414	In some cases, clusters of CNCs are found in gene deserts and a subset of these CNCs have been shown to play functional roles as enhancers [19–21]..	[[27, 30], [80, 83]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3415	It has been shown repeatedly that screening for CNCs is an effective method for identifying cis-regulatory modules of gene expression [18–25].	[[48, 51]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3416	That said, there is still considerable uncertainty about the function of most CNCs, and it has been suggested that some CNCs may serve other kinds of functions, perhaps including roles in chromatin structure or structural connections between chromosomes [26].	[[78, 81], [120, 123]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3417	In principle, another possibility might be that many CNCs could simply be regions of the genome with low mutation rates.	[[53, 56]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3418	However, two kinds of evidence argue convincingly that the low evolutionary rates of CNCs are indeed due to selective constraint.	[[85, 88]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3419	First, the allele frequency spectrum of human SNPs that lie within CNCs is skewed towards rare variants, consistent with the action of weak purifying selection [27,28].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3420	Second, the rate of evolutionary change of CNCs is closer to the neutral rate in primates than in rodents [28,29].	[[43, 46]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3421	Hence, in this study, in view of the likely functional importance of CNCs, we set out to describe the patterns of evolutionary sequence change in these elements.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3422	We start with a simple null model in which the evolution of each CNC is characterized by a single substitution rate parameter r that accounts for varying levels of constraint and local mutation rate across CNCs.	[[65, 68], [206, 209]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3423	For each CNC we compare the null model to a hierarchy of alternative models that allow the CNC to have different evolutionary rates in different parts of the phylogeny.	[[9, 12], [91, 94]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3424	In the simplest alternative model, the CNC evolves at a single rate across the phylogeny except for one branch, which shows a change in rate (Figure 1).	[[39, 42]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3425	The tree beneath each CNC shows hypothetical branch lengths for the phylogeny connecting human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and dog (H, C, M, R, and D, respectively).	[[22, 25]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3426	Each CNC is associated with a single rate parameter r that accounts for variation in the local mutation rate and level of conservation; however, under the null model, the relative branch lengths are all the same.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3427	Here, we expand this kind of approach to look more broadly at evolutionary patterns of CNCs across the mammals..	[[87, 90]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3428	To scan for functionally interesting CNCs that are shaped by changing selection pressures, we examined regions that are conserved in up to eight vertebrates (human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and fugu; see Methods).	[[37, 40]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3429	In short, the “most conserved” regions represent 4.3% of the human genome that were identified as conserved by a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [10] (Methods).	[[147, 150]]	[]	['HMM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3430	The remaining data consisted of 231,285 CNCs spanning ∼48Mb.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3431	The alignments from UCSC make use of global alignment information across species, thus lowering the risk of incorrectly aligning paralogous CNCs as apparent orthologs.	[[140, 143]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3432	However, in order to further reduce the risk of this type of error, we filtered out 98,593 CNCs with human paralogs (see Methods).	[[91, 94]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3433	Since CNCs with different levels of conservation might show differences in their evolutionary patterns, we then subdivided the remaining CNCs into more homogeneous subsets according to conservation levels in chicken and fish (see Methods).	[[6, 9], [137, 140]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3434	Our study examines the properties of the two largest of these subsets, to be denoted as “mammalian” CNCs (conserved within mammals but not found in chicken or fish) and “amniotic” CNCs (conserved in mammals and chicken but not found in fish).	[[100, 103], [180, 183]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3435	For both the mammalian and amniotic CNCs, our analysis studied evolutionary patterns across the history of the five mammalian species only..	[[36, 39]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3436	Our final dataset consists of 82,335 mammalian CNCs (for a total of 18.5 Mb) and 16,575 amniotic CNCs (4.6 Mb).	[[47, 50], [97, 100]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3437	The median sizes of CNCs in the two groups are 201 and 240 bp, respectively.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3438	We find that overall, the amniotic CNCs have a longer length distribution than the mammalian CNCs, consistent with previous results [17].	[[35, 38], [93, 96]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3439	Assuming the Felsenstein 84 substitution model [31], we obtained maximum likelihood estimates of the average numbers of substitutions on each branch of the mammalian tree for each of our CNCs (see Methods; Table S3).	[[187, 190]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3440	Summing across all branches on the tree, the average number of substitutions per site is 0.16 for amniotic CNCs and 0.24 for mammalian CNCs.	[[107, 110], [135, 138]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3441	Notice that, as might be expected, amniotic CNCs show lower overall substitution rates than mammalian CNCs.	[[44, 47], [102, 105]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3442	We estimate that the average substitution rates of our amniotic CNCs and mammalian CNCs are ∼20% and ∼29% of the neutral rate (based on comparison to local unconserved sequences), respectively.	[[64, 67], [83, 86]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3443	Overall, our CNCs are more conserved on average than the original set of “most conserved” regions identified by Siepel et al.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3444	We also examined the location of CNCs with respect to nearby genes.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3445	For each CNC, we computed the distance to the nearest gene without considering gene orientation.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3446	Thirty-seven percent of the mammalian CNCs are in introns, and the remainder are intergenic.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3447	Among intergenic CNCs, 10% are within 10 kb of a gene, 27% are between 10 kb and 100 kb, and 26% are greater than 100 kb from any gene.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3448	The amniotic CNCs have a similar overall distribution in the genome, although they are significantly more clustered (Table S2; Figure S2).	[[13, 16]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3449	Overall, we find that CNCs are distributed across the genome approximately at random with respect to the locations of nearby genes (Table S2), as noted previously [18]..	[[22, 25]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3450	Analysis of the relationship of CNCs with PANTHER gene ontology (GO) categories [32] shows that genes related to developmental processes are significantly enriched near CNCs (1.5-fold enrichment, p < 10−21), as seen previously [9,10,13] (see Methods; Tables S4 and S5).	[[32, 35], [169, 172], [65, 67]]	[[50, 63]]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'GO']	['gene ontology']	PMC1971121.nxml
3451	The genes in the “signal transduction” and “nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism” categories are enriched near mammalian CNCs and amniotic CNCs, respectively (1.2-fold enrichment, p < 10−11; and 1.3-fold enrichment, p < 10−7).	[[135, 138], [153, 156]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3452	Olfaction genes are ∼15-fold underrepresented in our dataset, presumably because olfactory genes tend to be highly duplicated and our filtering process removes duplicated CNCs..	[[171, 174]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3453	To identify CNCs that have been targets of selection, we introduce a likelihood ratio test that we call the “Shared Rates Test” (SRT).	[[12, 15], [129, 132]]	[]	['CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3454	Under the null model, the divergence times of lineages are shared across CNCs, but each CNC may evolve faster or slower according to its local mutation rate and level of evolutionary constraint.	[[73, 76], [88, 91]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3455	For each CNC, we test whether any branches are surprisingly long or short compared to the others, indicating speed-ups or slow-downs of the substitution rate.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3456	In our model, each branch of the mammalian tree has a branch-length parameter vb, defined as the average number of substitutions per site on branch b for CNCs evolving under a constant level of constraint.	[[154, 157]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3457	(Here, vb is defined as the average number of substitutions per site on branch b across all CNCs.) In addition, under the null hypothesis, each CNC is associated with a single rate parameter r0(h) (where h indicates a particular CNC).	[[92, 95], [144, 147], [229, 232]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3458	Then the number of substitutions that occur in CNC h, on branch b has an expectation at each site of Nb,h, where.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3459	Our model is designed so that all CNCs have the same expected tree shape (i.e., the ratios of expected branch lengths are the same).	[[34, 37]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3460	However the total size of the tree is allowed to vary according to r0(h), in order to reflect variation in mutation rates and the level of selective constraint across CNCs.	[[167, 170]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3461	In summary, the null model allows mutation rates and levels of constraint to vary across CNCs, and it allows for the property that broad-scale mutation rates may vary across lineages..	[[89, 92]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3462	In addition to the basic null model, we consider a family of alternative models that allow additional rate parameters for particular CNCs.	[[133, 136]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3463	In the extreme alternative, each of the seven branches evolves with its own rate ri(h), giving a total of seven rate parameters for the CNC in question.	[[136, 139]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3464	(For simplicity of notation, we will henceforth drop the notation h on the rate parameters.) In the extreme case, to test the hypotheses H0: r1 = r2 = ···= r7(= r0 ) versus HA: r1 ≠ r2 ≠ ···≠ r7 at a particular CNC, we compute the SRT as where L is the likelihood of the sequence data for the five mammalian species, maximized with respect to the rate parameters, and with the fixed estimate of branch lengths parameters ( ) and the sequence evolution model.	[[211, 214], [231, 234]]	[]	['CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3465	Large values of the SRT indicate a substantially better fit of the alternative than the null model.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3466	One analysis performs model selection using the SRT, while the other tests for individual branches with rate changes.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3467	Rewriting the SRT in this way provides the convenient property that SRTi > 0 implies that ri is larger than the background rate r0, −i, and hence branch i shows a rate speed-up relative to the rest of the tree; conversely, SRTi < 0 implies a slow-down on branch i.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3468	As a convention, when we subscript SRT by a character or number, it will represent the signed likelihood ratio statistic testing for rate changes on the indicated branch.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3469	Otherwise, the notation SRT without subscripts will be used to indicate use of an unsigned test statistic, in the form of Equations 2 and 3..	[[24, 27]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3470	Our SRT is a likelihood ratio test and, as such, standard theory suggests that under the null hypothesis the test statistic should asymptotically follow a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of estimated parameters between the constrained (null) and less-constrained (alternative) models.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3471	Therefore, when the null hypothesis is true and the number of sites in a CNC is large enough, the unsigned SRT might be expected to follow the chi-square distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of rate parameters between the two models.	[[73, 76], [107, 110]]	[]	['CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3472	Similarly, under the null, the signed test SRTi is constructed to have a standard normal distribution as the CNC size goes to infinity.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3473	An additional consideration is that we do not want the estimated null branch lengths (vb) to be heavily influenced by outlier CNCs with evidence for selection.	[[126, 129]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3474	To mitigate the impact of such CNCs, we first identify CNCs with clear overall departures from the null model (SRT > 25 in the global six degrees of freedom test, corresponding to p < 0.00034), and then reestimate the branch lengths after dropping those nonneutral CNCs, which represent 2.8% and 3.8% of the total mammalian and amniotic CNCs, respectively..	[[31, 34], [55, 58], [265, 268], [337, 340], [111, 114]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3475	In summary, then, our analysis performs the following steps: (1) Estimate maximum likelihood branch lengths and rates under the null; (2) identify outlier CNCs that have SRT > 25 comparing the seven- and one-parameter models; (3) drop outlier CNCs and recalculate the null branch lengths and rates; and (4) compute the shared rates test statistics for each CNC according to a range of alternative models..	[[155, 158], [243, 246], [357, 360], [170, 173]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3476	For reasons discussed below, in practice these analyses were performed in a sliding window of 50 consecutive CNCs, as defined by position in the human physical map.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3477	All analyses considered the mammalian and amniotic CNCs separately..	[[51, 54]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3478	Variation in mutation rates or levels of CNC conservation across genomic regions should not be problematic for our method, provided that the substitution rate in any given region maintains a constant ratio to the average across the mammalian phylogeny.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3479	If a CNC is in a region with a higher, or lower, mutation rate than average, this effect should simply be absorbed into the rate parameter that we estimate for each CNC as part of our null model.	[[5, 8], [165, 168]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3480	Values for the upper two plots are calculated in nonoverlapping windows of 50 consecutive CNCs..	[[90, 93]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3481	The dashed blue horizontal lines indicate the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the (unsmoothed) distribution expected if there were no spatial heterogeneity (estimated by randomly shuffling the location of Chromosome 2 CNCs)..	[[214, 217]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3482	If average tree shapes were constant across the genome, we could use CNCs from across the genome to estimate the tree shape for our null model.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3483	After some experimentation, we settled on using a sliding window of 50 consecutive CNCs to estimate the tree shape.	[[83, 86]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3484	That is, we test each CNC for significant departures from the tree shape in a 50-CNC window that, in the human physical map, is centered near the CNC in question (see Methods).	[[22, 25], [81, 84], [146, 149]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3485	On average, this window size corresponds to 525 kb and 1.3 Mb (median) for mammalian CNCs and amniotic CNCs, respectively..	[[85, 88], [103, 106]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3486	Overall, we find that using the sliding window method produces only a modest impact on the rate of significant CNCs, but it should improve our inferences by taking into account the local variation in tree shapes (Figures 2 and S4).	[[111, 114]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3487	An obvious concern about using a sliding window based on the locations of CNCs in humans is that due to chromosomal rearrangements, CNCs that are close together in humans may not be close together in other mammals.	[[74, 77], [132, 135]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3488	Fortunately, our window size is relatively small compared to the typical size of syntenic blocks [8,39] and in Figure 3, we show that the results of tests on the human lineage are highly concordant whether we use windows based on the human or mouse physical maps and, indeed, are only modestly different from the results using all CNCs together.	[[331, 334]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3489	Consequently, all subsequent results use 50-CNC windows based on the human map..	[[44, 47]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3490	The SRTh values for amniotic CNCs were computed separately based on windows defined using the human genome position (x-axis) and the mouse genome position (y-axis).	[[29, 32]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3491	This means that weakly constrained sites in CNCs are likely to evolve more quickly in primates than in rodents (which have larger effective population sizes).	[[44, 47]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3492	This effect has been observed in a comparison between the evolutionary rates of CNCs and putatively neutral flanking sequences [29].	[[80, 83]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3493	Hence—in contrast to our null model—one might expect the overall tree shape for a CNC to depend on its level of selective constraint..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3494	To investigate this issue, we classified CNCs into four different levels of conservation, according to their substitution rates on the dog lineage.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3495	However, we find that the variation across CNCs is relatively small (less than 11% change across different classes of CNCs) and much less than when CNCs are compared to neutral sequences (Table S3).	[[43, 46], [118, 121], [148, 151]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3496	As shown below, we do not have the power to detect such small variations in tree shape at individual CNCs, so we conclude that it is not necessary to control for overall conservation level more carefully for the current study..	[[101, 104]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3497	For each CNC, we calculated SRTi for each of the seven branches of the mammalian tree to identify CNCs that have experienced a speed-up or slow-down on a particular branch.	[[9, 12], [98, 101]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3498	Figure 4A shows the histogram of p-values on the mouse lineage (SRTm) for the mammalian CNCs.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3499	The histogram is flat for intermediate p-values with peaks at both ends, suggesting that most CNCs fit the null distribution of SRTm, but with a substantial number of outliers.	[[94, 97]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3500	At the significance level of 0.001, 1027 (1.2%) and 503 (0.6%) mammalian CNCs show speed-ups and slow-downs, respectively.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3501	Among amniotic CNCs, 228 (1.4%) and 106 (0.6%) show speed-ups and slow-downs, respectively on the mouse lineage..	[[15, 18]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3502	The peaks on the left and the right indicate an excess of CNCs that are fast and slow evolving in mice, respectively..	[[58, 61]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3504	Fast- and slow-evolving CNCs are indicated in red and blue, respectively.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3505	The violet dashed horizontal line shows the genome-wide average substitution rate on the mouse lineage for unconstrained regions near the fast-evolving CNCs (see text).	[[152, 155]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3506	Nine CNCs that have evolved significantly faster than their local neutral rates on the mouse lineage (p < 0.05) are indicated by light blue dots..	[[5, 8]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3507	Figure 4B plots the expected and observed branch lengths on the mouse lineage for the CNCs that are significant at p < 0.001 in each tail.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3508	(Similar plots for other lineages are shown in Figure S5.) The red points above the diagonal indicate CNCs with rate speed-ups.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3509	For the central 95% of the significantly fast-evolving CNCs, the observed branch lengths are between 0.04 to 0.13 substitutions per site, and are 2–4-fold higher than the expected branch lengths.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3510	The blue points below the diagonal are CNCs with reduced branch lengths.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3511	Nearly half of these CNCs accumulated no substitutions on the mouse lineage..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3512	The other long lineages show similar p-value histograms though with some variability in the proportion of significant CNCs.	[[118, 121]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3513	The dog lineage is the most enriched for signals, with 2.3% and 1.9% of mammalian CNCs showing speed-ups and slow-downs, respectively, at p < 0.001 (in each tail).	[[82, 85]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3514	Even after a stringent Bonferroni correction, 186 and 46 CNCs, respectively, are still significant at p = 0.001 in the dog lineage.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3515	The overall results for amniotic CNCs are similar, but the fraction of significant results is slightly higher on each branch (Table S8).	[[33, 36]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3516	For most lineages, our significance threshold (one-sided p-value < 0.001 on each end) corresponds to a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) between 0.05 and 0.1 (Table S9)..	[[137, 140]]	[[115, 135]]	['FDR']	['false discovery rate']	PMC1971121.nxml
3517	Since the distribution of SRTi on the human and chimpanzee lineages does not follow the standard asymptotic distribution, we simulated data under the null over a range of substitution rates that cover the observed range over all 50-CNC windows (see Methods).	[[232, 235]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3518	We account for heterogeneity in the distribution of SRTi across bins of CNCs with different numbers of expected substitutions on the tested lineage by computing p-values based on the empirical null distribution of SRTi constructed in each bin (unpublished data).	[[72, 75]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3519	At a significance level of 0.001, 256 mammalian CNCs and 59 amniotic CNCs, respectively, show rate speed-ups on the human lineage (Table S8).	[[48, 51], [69, 72]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3520	Our human results allow a comparison to the human accelerated regions (HARs) identified by Pollard et al.	[[71, 74]]	[[44, 68]]	['HAR']	['human accelerated region']	PMC1971121.nxml
3521	Among the top 49 HARs, which include two coding regions, 34 overlap with CNCs in our dataset; however, generally, the HARs are considerably shorter and more conserved and lie within our CNCs.	[[73, 76], [186, 189], [17, 20], [118, 121]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'HAR', 'HAR']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3522	Perhaps not surprisingly, since the HARs are the top genome-wide hits in their data, the signals in our overlapping CNCs tend to be weaker.	[[116, 119], [36, 39]]	[]	['CNC', 'HAR']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3523	Among the 34 CNCs, just five CNCs are significant in our analysis at a genome-wide FDR less than 0.05.	[[13, 16], [29, 32], [83, 86]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'FDR']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3524	Nonetheless, our CNCs that overlap HARs do show a strong enrichment of modest signals.	[[17, 20], [35, 38]]	[]	['CNC', 'HAR']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3525	Our human lineage p-values are <0.01 for 26 of the 34 CNCs overlapping HARs, and are <0.1 for 33 of the 34 (Table S10)..	[[54, 57], [71, 74]]	[]	['CNC', 'HAR']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3526	Within our dataset, one of the most significant CNCs on the human lineage is a 144-bp amniotic CNC located on human Chromosome 21 starting at 33481809 (q22.11, NCBI Build 35).	[[48, 51], [95, 98]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3527	The p-value for this CNC is so small that it is difficult to evaluate by simulation; however, the standard normal approximation suggests that p ≈ 6 × 10−7 (our simulations indicate that this is conservative).	[[21, 24]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3530	(D) SRTh values for amniotic CNCs located on human Chromosome 21.	[[29, 32]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3531	The red circle indicates the CNC illustrated above..	[[29, 32]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3532	The function of this CNC is unclear but the two nearest genes are C21orf54, 17 kb upstream, and IFNAR2, 42 kb downstream of the CNC.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3533	This CNC is strongly conserved among the other mammalian species and chicken but does not appear to be present in the fugu genome.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3534	In addition to the rapid evolution on the human lineage, there is weak evidence for slower evolution of this CNC on the mouse and dog lineages (one-sided p-values = 0.011 and 0.023, respectively; see Figure 5B)..	[[109, 112]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3535	Thus far, we have focused on the simplest class of alternative models, in which a CNC changes substitution rate on a single branch only and has a constant background rate elsewhere on the tree.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3536	We now extend this approach in order to classify each CNC according to a family of more complicated models of evolutionary patterns..	[[54, 57]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3537	Then, each CNC may have between one and six “selected” lineages, and each selected lineage evolves at its own rate.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3538	We use a modified Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) procedure to classify each CNC into its best model.	[[48, 51], [80, 83]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3539	We estimate that ∼68% (54,643/81,957) of the mammalian CNCs evolve at a single rate.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3540	The remaining nonneutral CNCs show rate changes on at least one lineage.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3541	The number of CNCs assigned to each model category decreases with increasing model complexity.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3542	Among the 32% of CNCs with more than one rate, ∼75% (20,420/27,314) exhibit rate changes on a single lineage but not on the remaining lineages and ∼9% (2,419/27,314) exhibit rate changes on the primate or the rodent lineage that are inherited across all branches below.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3543	However, there are 638 and 530 CNCs that show rate speed-ups on the human and chimpanzee lineages, respectively, far more than the four and eight CNCs, respectively, showing slow-downs.	[[31, 34], [146, 149]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3544	(A) Classification of evolutionary patterns in mammalian CNCs according to our modified AIC.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3545	(B) The tree shows how many of the CNCs that are best fit by the two-parameter model have altered rates on each branch.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3546	The classification of the remaining 2,419 CNCs with two rate parameters that fall into our compound models is summarized in Table S12..	[[42, 45]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3547	Since there is no strong tendency towards an excess of speed-ups over slow-downs on this lineage, it is unlikely that this can be explained by occasional CNCs with low-quality dog sequence.	[[154, 157]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3548	Perhaps there is greater fine-scale variation on the dog lineage that is not well captured by our 50-CNC window method (see Methods; Figure S8)..	[[101, 104]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3549	As discussed above, we have identified many CNCs with significantly accelerated rates on one or more branches.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3550	In order to address this issue, we estimated substitution rates in unconserved sequences near each CNC to estimate local neutral rates (see Methods).	[[99, 102]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3551	We then determined how many of the CNCs showing rate speed-ups have an accelerated rate that actually exceeds the corresponding lineage-specific neutral rate.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3552	If the rate in a CNC actually exceeds the local neutral rate, this is strong evidence for adaptive evolution.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3553	We observe that most CNCs showing accelerations on the human and chimpanzee branches indeed have rate estimates exceeding the neutral rates; of these, more than half are actually significantly faster than the neutral rate at p < 0.05.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3554	Meanwhile, the other branches of the mammalian tree all show smaller fractions of CNCs with rates that exceed the neutral rate, and very few of these are significantly faster than the neutral rate.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3555	One plausible explanation might be that if there is sufficiently rapid evolution on a long branch, this might cause an otherwise conserved element not to be classified as a “most conserved” region by the HMM [10].	[[204, 207]]	[]	['HMM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3556	Moreover, we see the same effect for both the mammalian and amniotic CNCs (Table 1), even though the HMM data for the latter include the relatively long branch to chicken, and should therefore be much less susceptible to this effect..	[[69, 72], [101, 104]]	[]	['CNC', 'HMM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3557	Evidence for adaptive evolution in fast-evolving CNCs.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3558	Instead, to explain these observations, we hypothesize that the rate speed-ups that we detect may often reflect rapid bursts of adaptation in which a CNC accumulates a series of sequence changes, thus modifying its function.	[[150, 153]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3559	Our data argue strongly against a model in which a CNC adapts continuously over extended periods of evolutionary time, as such a model should also produce signals on the long branches..	[[51, 54]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3560	We have also performed analyses of the locations of CNCs showing branch-specific speed-ups, with respect to nearby genes.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3561	[27] found that the frequency spectrum in CNCs is most skewed towards rare variants (indicating weak purifying selection) in introns and near genes, and is less skewed in CNCs that are far from genes..	[[42, 45], [171, 174]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3562	To test whether CNCs showing speed-ups on particular branches occur at higher rates near to or far from genes, we divided all our CNCs into four classes: intronic, within 10 kb of a gene, between 10 kb and 100 kb, and greater than 100 kb from any gene.	[[16, 19], [130, 133]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3563	We found that on the mouse and rat lineages, CNCs showing speed-ups (p < 0.001 on the branch-specific test SRTi) occur at higher rates in introns and within 10 kb of genes than among CNCs further from genes.	[[45, 48], [183, 186]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3564	We next looked at whether CNCs showing significant rate speed-ups are more likely to be in the proximity of particular kinds of genes [17], using the PANTHER GO database [32].	[[26, 29], [158, 160]]	[]	['CNC', 'GO']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3565	A significant difficulty in this sort of analysis is that even for those CNCs that act as cis-regulators, it is unknown which of the nearby genes is being regulated.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3566	However, as a rather imperfect proxy for this we simply used, for each CNC, the nearest gene (in either orientation).	[[71, 74]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3567	For each branch of the mammalian tree, we divided the CNCs into those with increased rate on that branch (by AIC) and used CNCs evolving under the null model as “neutral” controls.	[[109, 112], [54, 57], [123, 126]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3568	We looked at whether particular biological process categories were enriched among the nearest genes of the selected CNCs compared to the neutral CNCs..	[[116, 119], [145, 148]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3569	For mammalian CNCs, there is significant enrichment of the process categories “amino acid activation” and “other coenzyme and prosthetic group metabolism” on the dog and the lineage leading to the common ancestor of mouse and rat (rodent lineage), respectively, at p < 0.05 after Bonferroni adjustment.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3570	For mammalian CNCs, the “sensory perception” category appears in the top ten enriched biological processes for three out of the seven lineages.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3571	However, in summary, we view these GO associations as rather tentative, since none of them is highly significant or highly repeatable across branches of the tree.	[[35, 37]]	[]	['GO']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3572	Our paper presents a new approach to studying the evolutionary patterns of CNCs.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3573	We find that a large fraction of CNCs (∼32%) do not fit a simple model of evolution with a consistent substitution pattern across the mammalian tree.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3574	Among those CNCs that do not fit our null model, ∼75% show changes in evolutionary rate on a single branch of the mammalian tree, while the remainder have more complex substitution patterns.	[[12, 15]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3575	In many cases—particularly on the short branches of the phylogeny—CNCs with rate accelerations on a particular branch significantly exceed the neutral rate on that branch, suggesting that the changes are driven by adaptive evolution.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3576	A very recent paper by Galtier and Duret [42] argues that many of the recently reported HARs [5] are likely the result of biased gene conversion (BGC).	[[146, 149], [88, 91]]	[[122, 144]]	['BGC', 'HAR']	['biased gene conversion']	PMC1971121.nxml
3577	One of the main characteristics of BGC is an excess of AT → GC transitions.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['BGC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3578	In some of our CNCs showing accelerations on the human lineage, we also observe this transition bias, which seems to be larger with increased acceleration signals.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3579	However, for most fast-evolving CNCs, the numbers of AT → GC changes roughly match the distribution expected based on the overall distribution across random CNCs (Figure S9).	[[32, 35], [157, 160]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3580	In summary, these data suggest that some of the fast-evolving CNCs may in fact be due to BGC, however, that most fast-evolving CNCs do not show the signal expected for BGC..	[[89, 92], [168, 171], [62, 65], [127, 130]]	[]	['BGC', 'BGC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3581	Overall, our results imply that either the levels of functional constraint or the functional roles of CNCs are reasonably changeable across the timespan of mammalian evolution.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3582	Although it lies beyond the scope of this paper, it will be of interest to use experimental approaches to probe the functional significance of the many CNCs that we have identified as having had bursts of rapid evolution [5,25]..	[[152, 155]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3583	One natural concern is that our CNC alignments might occasionally align paralogs.	[[32, 35]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3584	This is a serious concern in principle; however, we have aimed to aggressively filter out CNCs with related paralogs to minimize this effect, in addition to making use of global alignments.	[[90, 93]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3585	A related concern is that due to variation across lineages in effective population size, the evolutionary rates of CNCs with different levels of constraint might not scale linearly across the trees [29].	[[115, 118]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3586	However, our data show that this is a modest effect relative to the size of change needed to produce a significant rate change in a CNC (Table S15)..	[[132, 135]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3587	In this study, we aimed to classify CNCs according to their evolutionary patterns.	[[36, 39]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3588	To do so, we used a modified version of the AIC to find the model that best describes the pattern of evolution of each CNC.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3589	In particular, two natural models for rate changes in a CNC are (1) that the CNC has a one-time change in evolutionary pattern (for example, a burst of adaptation to acquire a new function), or (2) that the CNC changes function or evolutionary constraint in a way that is inherited across all branches below.	[[56, 59], [77, 80], [207, 210]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3590	More broadly, as we obtain increasing information about the functions of CNCs, we will increasingly be able to interpret the biological relevance of the patterns of rate changes detected here..	[[73, 76]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3591	We also downloaded the annotation of “most conserved” regions defined on the same multiple alignment by a phylogenetic HMM in June 2005 [10].	[[119, 122]]	[]	['HMM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3592	To define CNCs, we first extracted those conserved regions from the multiple alignment and then processed them by removing coding regions (exons in the “known gene” annotation, UCSC genome browser), repetitive sequences (marked by lower case letters in the alignment), and sites that are gaps or missing data in any of the five mammalian genome sequences.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3593	The remaining 231,285 regions out of the initial 1,451,896 most conserved regions comprised our raw dataset of CNCs and spanned ∼48 Mb..	[[111, 114]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3594	We used BLAT [44] to exclude spuriously aligned CNCs.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3595	We restricted our data to unique CNCs in which the human version of a CNC does not find any similar sequence (>50% sequence identity) elsewhere on the human genome.	[[33, 36], [70, 73]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3596	This resulted in discarding 24,234 CNCs (∼5.4 Mb).	[[35, 38]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3597	Furthermore, we required that each nonhuman mammalian verion of a CNC find the human version as the best match when it is BLATed against the whole human genome.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3598	This resulted in discarding an additional 74,359 CNCs (∼10.7 Mb)..	[[49, 52]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3599	However, we used the aligned chicken and fugu sequences to classify CNCs into different conservation level groups, of which we analyzed the two largest, denoted as “mammalian” and “amniotic” CNCs.	[[68, 71], [191, 194]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3600	Roughly speaking, a CNC was classified into the mammalian group if it is conserved across the mammalian genomes but not chicken or fugu, and into the amniotic group if it is conserved among the mammals and chicken but not fugu.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3601	To examine the scale of local variation in tree shape, we estimated tree shapes over a chosen set of window sizes of 10, 30, 50, or 100 consecutive CNCs (ordered according to the human genome position).	[[148, 151]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3602	Nonetheless, incorporating such variation into our model is important, since otherwise, regions that show a general pattern of evolution that departs from the shared pattern from all CNCs might produce clusters of spurious signals.	[[183, 186]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3603	After several trials, we decided to estimate tree shape using a sliding window of 50 CNCs with an overlap of 34 CNCs between successive windows.	[[85, 88], [112, 115]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3604	The one third of CNCs located in the center of each window use the estimated tree shape from that window.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3605	In order to reduce the effect of outliers (defined as having SRT > 25 with degrees of freedom of six), we estimate branch lengths in each window, drop outliers, and then reestimate the divergence times after dropping those nonneutral CNCs.	[[234, 237], [61, 64]]	[]	['CNC', 'SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3606	Through this procedure, we expect that our estimates are robust in the presence of outlier CNCs.	[[91, 94]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3607	Our preliminary analysis of classifying CNCs using the modified AIC showed that the number of CNCs with signals on the chimpanzee lineage was 48% larger than on the human lineage.	[[64, 67], [40, 43], [94, 97]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3608	Closer examination indicated that often CNCs with low-quality chimpanzee sequence (PanTro1) produced a large signal of rate changes on the chimpanzee lineage, since miscalled bases would appear as mutations.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3609	Therefore, we dropped any CNC that is classified by AIC into the group showing rate changes on the chimpanzee lineage but that has low-quality chimpanzee sequence..	[[52, 55], [26, 29]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3610	To identify those CNCs, the chimpanzee sequence in each CNC was BLATed to the chimpanzee genome (PanTro1).	[[18, 21], [56, 59]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3611	If this count was larger than 15, we considered the CNC to have low-quality chimpanzee data.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3612	A total of 378 mammalian and 89 amniotic CNCs that were significant on the chimpanzee lineage were dropped for this reason..	[[41, 44]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3613	Under the null hypothesis, our parameters are a set of seven branch lengths shared by all CNCs, and one additional local substitution rate for each CNC.	[[90, 93]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3614	Rather than maximizing the likelihood directly, we developed an expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) that efficiently maximizes many parameters jointly under the null model.	[[100, 102]]	[[64, 88]]	['EM']	['expectation-maximization']	PMC1971121.nxml
3615	The details are given in Text S1, but essentially, in our EM algorithm, each branch length is updated sequentially by computing the posterior number of substitutions on each branch and updating the related parameters accordingly.	[[58, 60]]	[]	['EM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3616	We find that our EM algorithm is stable to choices of initial starting points.	[[17, 19]]	[]	['EM']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3617	There are many possible models of CNC evolution, ranging from the simplest case, where there is a single rate across the entire tree, to the most extreme case, where each lineage evolves with its own rate.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3618	Here, we address how to classify CNCs according to their evolutionary patterns..	[[33, 36]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3619	Since there are many possible models, correct classification of the CNCs is likely to be difficult.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3620	For each CNC, we select the model that, among the 127 candidate models produces the highest value of the penalized likelihood, which is log(L) − (k + 1) + log((7 − k − 1)!} for our main class of alternative models, where L is the maximum likelihood and k is the number of selected lineages.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3621	We used these simulations to compare among three possible choices of penalty functions: (1) using only the number of parameters (AIC), (2) using only the Ewens prior (Ewens), and (3) using both the number of parameters and Ewens prior (AIC + Ewens), as detailed above.	[[129, 132], [236, 239]]	[]	['AIC', 'AIC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3622	The AIC + Ewens penalization provides the best control against over-fitting and that is what we use for our data analysis..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3623	There are 6,037 mammalian and 1,497 amniotic CNCs that show branch-specific accelerations on at least one lineage at significance level of 0.001 (based on the asymptotic distribution of SRTi).	[[45, 48]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3624	To see if these CNCs actually exceed the neutral rate on a particular branch showing speed-ups, we estimate the local “neutral” tree near each of those CNCs.	[[16, 19], [152, 155]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3625	Specifically, we take the surrounding 10 kb with each such CNC at the center, then exclude “most conserved” regions as well as exons to construct putatively neutral local regions.	[[59, 62]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3626	To test whether the accelerated rate exceeds the neutral rate on a particular branch i, we compute a likelihood ratio statistic testing the hypothesis H0: r0, −i, ri = ri, neutral versus HA:r0, −i, ri > ri, neutral only for those CNCs that have a substitution rate on the tested lineage ri that exceeds the neutral rate ri, neutral in the surrounding region.	[[230, 233]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3627	We performed simulation studies with the Felsenstein 84 sequence evolution model using evolver13, implemented in PAML [50], to assess the distributions of the SRT and SRTi statistics under the null model and to evaluate p-values when the distribution is not well approximated by the asymptotic theory..	[[159, 162]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3628	We simulated two sets of 1 million CNCs under the null, one set for the mammalian and one for the amniotic CNCs, matching the distribution of base frequencies, the CNC size, the variation in the local substitution rates, and the overall tree shape.	[[35, 38], [107, 110], [164, 167]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3629	Specifically, each of the 1 million simulated CNCs was based on the characteristics of a randomly sampled CNC in our dataset (sampling with replacement).	[[46, 49], [106, 109]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3630	We specified the branch lengths by rescaling the global tree estimated from all CNCs by the local substitution rate of the chosen CNC, and generated an alignment of five sequences of the corresponding size simulated on the specified tree..	[[80, 83], [130, 133]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3631	For each set of simulated CNCs, we obtained the empirical null distributions of statistics testing for various alternative scenarios (the simplest and most extreme cases are shown in Figure S3).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3632	We also grouped sets of CNCs into bins with similar CNC sizes and local substitution rates and examined empirical distributions for each bin separately (unpublished data).	[[24, 27], [52, 55]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3633	For these cases, since the inhomogeneity across bins was mainly explained by differences in the expected number of substitutions on the tested lineage, we reconstructed bins of CNCs according to the number of expected substitutions and evaluated p-values within each bin separately..	[[177, 180]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3634	We also simulated a number of CNC sets under various alternative scenarios to examine the performance of the modified AIC method.	[[118, 121], [30, 33]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3635	Specifically, for each k selected lineages (k = 0,…,6), we simulated 100,000 CNCs in which each CNC has k branches that evolve with their own rates.	[[77, 80], [96, 99]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3636	We extracted the nearest gene for each CNC without considering gene orientation.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3637	Here the distance from a CNC to a gene is the minimum of distances from the middle of the CNC to either end of the gene..	[[25, 28], [90, 93]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3638	The PANTHER GO database was downloaded from http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/prowler.jsp in March 2006.	[[12, 14]]	[]	['GO']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3639	For each conservation group, we examined what kinds of biological process categories are enriched for being: (1) near CNCs in general and (2) near CNCs showing lineage-specific rate increases compared to near CNCs evolving under the null model.	[[118, 121], [147, 150], [209, 212]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3640	The nearest genes of CNCs were used for this analysis..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3641	For (1), we compiled the list of all genes in the reference assembly and the list of genes near mammalian (or amniotic) CNCs.	[[120, 123]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3642	For (2), CNCs were first classified by the AIC (in order to obtain disjoint categories of CNCs showing signals of speedups on each lineage).	[[43, 46], [9, 12], [90, 93]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3643	For each category, we counted genes near CNCs under the null and near CNCs in each of the seven selection groups that show rate speed-ups on a single lineage.	[[41, 44], [70, 73]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3644	The reason for this is that multiple CNCs often have the same nearest neighbor.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3645	This effect is more pronounced in the null CNC group than in the selection groups.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3646	Consequently, if we count genes only once, then any biological functional category that is enriched near CNCs, in general, may be underrepresented in the null but overrepresented in each selection group.	[[105, 108]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3647	Since the numbers of selected CNCs are small for many gene categories, p-values were computed using Fisher's exact test.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3648	We have prepared a datafile that contains the list of all CNCs and summarizes our analysis results.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3649	To aid visual comparison of the plots, 1,741 mammalian CNCs (equal to the number of amniotic CNCs) were randomly selected and plotted here.	[[55, 58], [93, 96]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3650	Overall, amniotic CNCs are more conserved and more clustered than mammalian CNCs..	[[18, 21], [76, 79]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3651	The empirical null distributions are obtained from the simulated data that capture the variation in size and the local substitution rates of the mammalian CNCs.	[[155, 158]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3652	The bottom right plot is the histogram of SRT testing the alternative hypothesis in which each of the seven lineages evolves with its own rate.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['SRT']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3654	The tree for each CNC is simulated by taking the global tree estimated from all mammalian CNCs and multiplying certain branch length with rate changes (each line) by a scale factor (x-axis).	[[18, 21], [90, 93]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3655	The power is estimated as the fraction of being rejected at significance level of 0.001 among the 500 simulated CNCs.	[[112, 115]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3656	The number of parameters found by the AIC method is shown in the x-axis, and the fraction of detected CNCs among the 100,000 simulated CNCs under each scenario is shown in the y-axis..	[[38, 41], [102, 105], [135, 138]]	[]	['AIC', 'CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3658	The plots are the histograms of those proportions in random CNCs (A, C, and E) and fast-evolving mammalian CNCs (B, D, and F) across sets of homogeneous numbers of human-specific substitutions: A and B, seven or eight; C and D, five or six; and E and F, three or four..	[[60, 63], [107, 110]]	[]	['CNC', 'CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3661	Fractions of CNCs in intron and three intergenic regions (within 10 kb, between 10 kb and 100 kb, and greater than 100 kb from any gene) were computed within each group.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml
3662	The “Random” group indicates the expected distribution if CNCs were distributed completely at random in noncoding regions (estimated by sampling 2 million noncoding positions at random in the human genome)..	[[58, 61]]	[]	['CNC']	[]	PMC1971121.nxml

3802	Comparing metabolite QTLs with network eQTLs controlling the expression of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways indicates that all network eQTLs colocate with metabolic QTLs, but the inverse statement is not true, as some QTLs are detected only for metabolite traits.

3805	The Bay-0 and Sha accessions differed in both the quantity of glucosinolates accumulated and the specific structures synthesized, verifying that the Bay-0 × Sha RIL population is potentially informative for analyzing the relationship of eQTLs to metabolic variation.	[[237, 241], [161, 164]]	[]	['eQTL', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3806	In contrast, Bay-0 resembles Landsberg erecta (Ler), which contains mostly C3 hydroxy glucosinolates, with lower total aliphatic glucosinolate content (Table 1) [19,30].	[[47, 50]]	[]	['Ler']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3810	Transgressive segregation for this biosynthetic capability was previously observed in the Ler x Cvi RIL population and shown to result from epistasis between the GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong loci [6,30–32,35–37].

3811	In the Sha parent, the AOP2 enzyme fully converts all 4-MSO into but-3-enyl glucosinolate, preventing the detectable accumulation of 4-MSO within Sha.	[[54, 59], [133, 138]]	[]	['4-MSO', '4-MSO']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3812	In Bay-0, 4-MSO does not accumulate due to the Bay-0 allele at Elong, preventing the formation of 4C glucosinolates.	[[10, 15]]	[]	['4-MSO']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3813	Plants containing the GSL.AOPOHP (AOP3) allele from the Bay-0 parent and the GSL.ElongC4 (MAM1) allele from Sha accumulate 4-MSO and 4-MT because the AOP3 enzyme expressed by the GSL.AOPOHP allele from Bay-0 can not convert the 4-MSO precursor to hydroxyl glucosinolates (Figure 1) [31]..

3814	For this population, the transgressive segregation for the quantity of glucosinolates produced is almost entirely negative, as the RIL population includes numerous lines producing less total aliphatic glucosinolate than either parental accession, but no lines that accumulate average levels higher than the Sha parent (Table 1).	[[131, 134]]	[]	['RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3815	This is especially striking for total indolic glucosinolate content, where all of the RILs were significantly lower than both parents.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3816	Because the Bay-0 and Sha parents were grown concurrently with the RILs, this is not due to environmental effects.	[[67, 70]]	[]	['RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3817	This observation of negative transgressive segregation contrasts with the Ler × Cvi RIL population, where both positive and negative transgressive segregation was observed, with RILs producing both greater and lesser quantities of glucosinolates than either parental accession [30].	[[74, 77], [84, 87], [178, 181]]	[]	['Ler', 'RIL', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3818	Given that the GSL.AOP and GSL.ELONG loci are in common between both populations, this difference in transgressive segregation suggests the influence of additional QTLs that are not variable in both populations..

3819	However, recalculating heritabilities for the glucosinolate metabolites using the same 211 RILs measured in the eQTL analysis did not significantly change the values (unpublished data)..	[[112, 116], [91, 94]]	[]	['eQTL', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3821	Analysis of aliphatic glucosinolate variation among the RILs identified 11 QTLs that control either aliphatic glucosinolate content or the partitioning of aliphatic glucosinolates into particular structures (Figure 3).	[[75, 78], [56, 59]]	[]	['QTL', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3822	The QTLs affecting the largest number of aliphatic glucosinolate traits and causing the largest phenotypic differences were the previously identified GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong loci (Tables S4 and S5 and Figure 1).

3824	The GSL.ALIPH.II.42 and GSL.ALIPH.V.66 QTLs altered individual glucosinolate content and summations but did not have as dramatic an affect on the glucosinolate ratios (Figures 3 and 4).	[[4, 7], [24, 27], [39, 42]]	[]	['GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3825	In contrast, GSL.ALIPH.I.0, GSL.ALIPH.III.10, and GSL.ALIPH.IV.48 QTLs were more specific to the derived summation and ratio traits than to the raw glucosinolate metabolite accumulation (Figure 3 and Tables S4 and S5).

3826	For example, the GSL.ALIPH.IV.48 QTL influences only 3C aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation, and the GSL.ALIPH.I.0 QTL controls ratio traits involving 4-MT and 8C glucosinolate (Figure 4 and Tables S4 and S5).

3866	The most common pairwise interaction was detected between GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong, controlling 7 of 9 aliphatic glucosinolate metabolites (Figure 4).	[[62, 65], [58, 61], [70, 73]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3867	In contrast to the metabolites, most expression traits did not identify epistatic eQTL interactions.	[[82, 86]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3868	The few transcripts traits that identified epistatic eQTL interactions encode biosynthetic enzymes functioning in the early steps of the elongation cycle: MAM1, BCAT4, and an Aconitase.	[[53, 57]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3869	To investigate the nature of the epistatic interaction between GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong, we calculated mean phenotypic values for the RILs containing each of the allelic combinations at these two loci (Figure 6).

3870	GSL.AOP × GSL.Elong interaction had a negative epistatic effect on the total content of both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates, with lines possessing the nonparental allelic combination of GSL.AOPOHP from Bay-0 and GSL.ElongC4 from Sha exhibiting significantly lower glucosinolate content than either parent (Figure 6).

3872	The GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong loci also control the network expression mean z-score for the aliphatic biosynthetic gene network, but did not exhibit a pairwise epistasis for this trait (Figure 4).	[[8, 11], [4, 7], [16, 19]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3873	In contrast, the genes in the methionine elongation cycle did identify an epistatic interaction between GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong (Figure 6; BCAT4 is shown as an example).	[[108, 111], [104, 107], [116, 119]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3874	Substitution of the Bay-0 GSL.ElongC3 allele for the Sha allele in a background containing the Sha GSL.AOPAlk allele leads to increased accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic transcripts but lower aliphatic glucosinolate content (Figure 6).	[[26, 29], [99, 102]]	[]	['GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3875	We analyzed the indolic glucosinolate pathway as a second test of our ability to link eQTLs altering transcript levels for biosynthetic genes with metabolite accumulation QTLs.	[[86, 90], [171, 174]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3876	A total of 13 QTLs were identified that control the accumulation of indolic glucosinolates, their partitioning into particular structures, or both (Figure 7 and Table S8).	[[14, 17]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3877	Interestingly, the GSL.INDOLIC.IV.8 and GSL.INDOLIC.V.20 QTLs map to the same genomic locations as the previously known GSL.AOP and GSL.ELONG loci, which control aliphatic glucosinolate variation.

3878	Transgenic analysis confirmed that simulating the Sha GSL.AOP allele by introducing the AOP2 gene into a null background increases total indolic glucosinolate content by about 30% (p = 0.035).	[[58, 61], [54, 57]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3879	This shows that variation at GSL.AOP affects indolic glucosinolate metabolism and that there is cross-talk between the pathways for indolic and aliphatic glucosinolate production..	[[33, 36], [29, 32]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3891	Testing the identified indolic metabolite QTLs for pairwise epistatic interactions identified numerous epistatic interactions affecting indolic glucosinolate accumulation.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3892	Notably, the GSL.INDOLIC.II.15 QTL was detected as epistatically interacting with five other QTLs (GSL.INDOLIC.III.7, GSL.INDOLIC.III3.60, GSL.INDOLIC.IV4.36, GSL.INDOLIC.V.45, and GSL.INDOLIC.V.59; Table S8).	[[13, 16], [99, 102], [118, 121], [139, 142], [159, 162], [181, 184], [31, 34], [93, 96]]	[]	['GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3893	A regulation hypothesis is supported by the fact that the GSL.INDOLIC.II.15 region contains a massive trans-acting eQTL that influences transcript levels for more than 5,000 genes [17]..	[[115, 119], [58, 61]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3894	Analysis of eQTLs controlling transcript levels of individual indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes identified four eQTL clusters (GSL.INDOLIC.III.60, GSL.INDOLIC.IV.8, GSL.INDOLIC.V.45, and GSL.INDOLIC.V.59; Figure 7 and Tables S6 and S7).	[[12, 16], [119, 123], [134, 137], [154, 157], [172, 175], [194, 197]]	[]	['eQTL', 'eQTL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3895	Because the indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes are also believed to be coregulated, we estimated pathway expression mean z-value to map network QTLs.	[[150, 153]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3896	This identified the same four loci, plus three additional QTLs affecting expression of the indolic gene network (GSL.INDOLIC.II.15, GSL.INDOLIC.III.7, and GSL.INDOLIC.V.5).	[[113, 116], [132, 135], [155, 158], [58, 61]]	[]	['GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3897	All three of these network-specific eQTLs colocalized with metabolite QTLs, supporting the ability of the z-scale network approach to derive biological information.	[[36, 40], [70, 73]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3898	All seven eQTLs colocalize with loci that control either the accumulation or partitioning of the indolic glucosinolates produced by these genes.	[[10, 14]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3899	This suggests that the eQTLs controlling transcript levels for the indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes also affect variation in their metabolite products.	[[23, 27]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3900	Again, it remains to be tested whether the QTLs primarily affect transcript levels, causing downstream metabolite effects, or if the polymorphisms first affect the metabolites, influencing transcript levels through some form of feedback.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3901	There are also indolic metabolite QTLs, such as GSL.INDOLIC.IV.36, with no detectable impact on gene expression traits..	[[48, 51], [34, 37]]	[]	['GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3902	We used the Arabidopsis aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways to test our ability to link QTLs controlling metabolic and expression polymorphisms.	[[110, 113]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3903	A direct comparison of metabolite QTL and eQTL maps reveals that for both pathways, all eQTLs collocate with metabolite QTLs (Table 2, Figures 2 and 7).	[[42, 46], [88, 92], [34, 37], [120, 123]]	[]	['eQTL', 'eQTL', 'QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3904	However, the predictive capacity of eQTLs is not perfect, as indicated by the presence of metabolite-specific QTL clusters that do not associate with eQTL clusters..	[[36, 40], [150, 154], [110, 113]]	[]	['eQTL', 'eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3905	Shared and Unique QTLs.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3906	Metabolite-specific QTL clusters cannot be explained by the superior power of the metabolite QTL analysis, which used 403 RILs versus the 211 phenotyped for transcript level, as restriction of the metabolite analysis to the set of 211 RILs included in the expression QTL analysis did not alter this result (unpublished data).	[[20, 23], [93, 96], [267, 270], [122, 125], [235, 238]]	[]	['QTL', 'QTL', 'QTL', 'RIL', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3907	In addition, higher heritability of transcript levels versus metabolite traits creates a higher statistical likelihood of failure to detect metabolite QTLs than eQTLs (Figure 2).	[[161, 165], [151, 154]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3908	Although the eQTL and metabolite QTL analysis were done at different times, all experiments used seed from the same mothers, and were grown in the same growth chamber under similar growth conditions.	[[13, 17], [33, 36]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3909	We therefore feel that biological processes, rather than statistical or experimental considerations, explain these metabolite-specific QTLs.	[[135, 138]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3910	Metabolite-specific QTLs could be caused by metabolic feedback mechanisms, whereby a product is responsible for fine-tuning the activity of a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3911	Alternatively, metabolite-specific QTLs may identify loci controlling flux of substrates into the pathway.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3912	In addition, polymorphisms that affect post-translational regulation or structural variation in enzymes could lead to metabolite QTLs independent of loci controlling transcript levels.	[[129, 132]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3913	A similar result would be observed if the metabolite QTLs were caused by variation in other biosynthetic pathways that affect substrate availability, or by eQTLs affecting an unknown biosynthetic gene.	[[156, 160], [53, 56]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3914	The presence of QTLs that exclusively affect metabolites and not expression traits illustrates the complexity involved in extrapolating variation in gene expression to changes in metabolite content..	[[16, 19]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3915	The three most consistently detected QTLs for aliphatic glucosinolate content and transcript variation were GSL.AOP, GSL.Elong, and GSL.V.66.	[[112, 115], [108, 111], [117, 120], [132, 135], [37, 40]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3916	Two of these network QTLs, AOP and Elong, contain cis-eQTLs controlling variation in transcript levels for enzymes located at the beginning and end of the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway.	[[27, 30], [54, 58], [21, 24]]	[]	['AOP', 'eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3917	Neither AOP nor Elong has previously been associated with regulation of other glucosinolate biosynthetic or regulatory genes.	[[8, 11]]	[]	['AOP']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3918	The GSL.AOP QTL is likely controlling glucosinolate content and expression through natural variation in the AOP2 gene (Figure 5).	[[8, 11], [4, 7], [12, 15]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3919	For the GSL.Elong network QTLs, the comparison of eQTLs to metabolite QTLs suggests that variation in transcript levels for at least two biosynthetic genes (MAM1 and MAM3) at GSL.Elong directly causes metabolic variation, and that this biosynthetic variation may alter transcript regulation for nearly the entire biosynthetic pathway.	[[50, 54], [8, 11], [175, 178], [26, 29], [70, 73]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3920	One possibility is that a metabolic intermediate produced in the GSL.Elong4C background negatively regulates gene expression.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3921	Alternatively, both the GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong loci could possess tightly linked second loci that cause the observed transcriptional polymorphisms and also interact epistatically.	[[28, 31], [24, 27], [36, 39]]	[]	['AOP', 'GSL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3922	Comparing the remaining network eQTLs to candidate glucosinolate transcriptional regulators shows that the GSL.ALIPH.V.66 QTL overlaps the physical position of the MYB28 transcription factor, which has a large-effect cis-eQTL [17,39].	[[32, 36], [221, 225], [107, 110], [122, 125]]	[]	['eQTL', 'eQTL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3923	Likewise, the GSL.INDOLIC.V.45 and GSL.INDOLIC.V.59 QTLs overlap the physical position of the indolic transcription factors, ATR1 and ATR2, and both genes have cis-eQTLs [17,29,46].	[[164, 168], [14, 17], [35, 38], [52, 55]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3924	This suggests that these three QTLs may be explained by variation in the expression of these known regulatory genes.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3925	In addition, the GSL.ALIPH.I.0 and GSL.ALIPH.III.10 QTLs overlap with the physical position for the aliphatic glucosinolate transcriptional regulators AtDOF1.1 and IQD1, respectively [28,47].	[[17, 20], [35, 38], [52, 55]]	[]	['GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3926	Neither gene exhibits a cis-eQTL, suggesting that if these genes are responsible for GSL.ALIPH.I.0 and GSL.ALIPH.III.10 QTLs, it is potentially due to an activity polymorphism.	[[28, 32], [85, 88], [103, 106], [120, 123]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3927	The GSL.ALIPH.II.15 QTL, a major network eQTL for transcript levels for both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate pathways, does not overlap any known biosynthetic or regulatory genes.	[[41, 45], [4, 7], [20, 23]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3928	This locus does colocalize with a massive eQTL cluster controlling the expression of several thousand genes [17].	[[42, 46]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3929	These results suggest that eQTLs can control metabolite production through a variety of direct and indirect regulatory mechanisms..	[[27, 31]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3930	While most eQTLs co-located with QTL clusters controlling several metabolites, there were also instances in which a statistically significant association between expression and metabolic phenotypes was limited to one or few metabolic traits.	[[11, 15], [33, 36]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3931	For example, SGT74B1 catalyzes glycosylation of the characteristic glucosinolate backbone structure, and its expression is controlled by a single eQTL at GSL.ALIPH.I20 [48].	[[146, 150], [154, 157]]	[]	['eQTL', 'GSL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3932	This large-effect cis-eQTL maps to a 100-kb interval that includes the physical position of SGT74B1.	[[22, 26]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3933	Instead, the lack of detected effects in this study for this eQTL on the accumulation of other glucosinolates is likely because genotypes accumulating but-3-enyl glucosinolate also exhibit the highest level of total aliphatic glucosinolates within this population (Table 1).	[[61, 65]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3934	Consequently, unexpected factors directly related to biochemical pathway connectivity and flux can interfere with our ability to directly associate eQTLs for biosynthetic genes with specific metabolite QTLs.	[[148, 152], [202, 205]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3935	As such, eQTLs are not predictive in all contexts..	[[9, 13]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3936	This comparative analysis of eQTLs to metabolic QTLs has provided novel insights, including the identification of the enzymes AOP2 and MAM1 as well as the transcription factor MYB28 as potential regulators of transcript accumulation for the complete aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway.	[[29, 33], [48, 51]]	[]	['eQTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3937	In addition, differential expression of the ATR1 and ATR2 transcription factors have been implicated as the underlying cause of QTLs controlling the indolic glucosinolate pathway.	[[128, 131]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3938	Identification and validation of the molecular causes of the 17 different QTLs identified in this study will require a complex mixture of experiments ranging from transgenic complementation to validate the gene, promoter swaps to validate the difference in gene expression, and recombination mapping to more precisely identify the causal polymorphism [49]..	[[74, 77]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3939	A broader metabolomics analysis in comparison to eQTLs for all known enzymatic loci will be required to test whether these differences in heritability and epistasis are a general feature of transcriptomic and metabolomic networks.	[[49, 53]]	[]	['eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3940	Furthermore, this analysis shows that the comparison of eQTLs to metabolite QTLs within an a priori–defined framework can identify complex regulatory mechanisms whereby variation in enzymes or metabolites may feed back to alter transcript accumulation.

3950	Heritability of each glucosinolate trait was estimated using the general linear model procedure within SAS (http://www.sas.com) where broad sense heritability was defined as σ2g/σ2p (Table S1), where σ2g is the estimated genetic variance for the metabolite among different genotypes in this sample of RILs, and σ2p is the estimated phenotypic variance for the metabolite [2]..	[[301, 304]]	[]	['RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3951	Heritability, eQTL position, eQTL effect, and transcript levels for individual transcripts were obtained using the RMA estimated expression values from the previously published analysis of gene expression in the Bay × Sha population [17].

3958	To maximize our ability to detect all possible QTLs, we used the averages from each experiment, May 2004, May 2005, and August 2005, as well as the average across all experiments to conduct four QTL mapping tests.	[[47, 50], [195, 198]]	[]	['QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3962	The Eqtl module of QTL Cartographer was used to automatically identify the location of each significant QTL for each trait from each experiment and the whole experiment average (Tables S5–S7) [65].	[[19, 22], [104, 107]]	[]	['QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3963	In addition, all data from the three different experiments were used in the multi-trait composite interval algorithm within QTL Cartographer v2.5..	[[124, 127]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3964	QTL clusters were identified by using the QTL summation approach, where the position of each QTL for each trait for each experiment is indicated by a 1, and the number of traits controlled by a QTL at a given position is totaled [18].	[[42, 45], [93, 96], [194, 197]]	[]	['QTL', 'QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3965	This summation was conducted using four groups: Group I, all aliphatic glucosinolate metabolite traits; Group II, all eQTLs for aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes; Group III, all indolic glucosinolate metabolite traits; and Group IV, all eQTLs for indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes.	[[118, 122], [246, 250]]	[]	['eQTL', 'eQTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3966	These QTL clusters identified a set of defined genetic positions that were then named respective to their position and whether they affected aliphatic or indolic glucosinolate content (Tables S5–S7).	[[6, 9]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3967	The QTLs at the previously characterized and cloned AOP and Elong loci were named as such [30–32,69]..	[[52, 55], [4, 7]]	[]	['AOP', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3968	To further validate each QTL identified and query for potential epistasis, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using all experiments.	[[113, 118], [25, 28]]	[[91, 111]]	['ANOVA', 'QTL']	['analysis of variance']	PMC1976331.nxml
3969	For each trait, the markers most closely associated with each significant main-effect QTL for that trait were used as main effect cofactors.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml
3970	An automated SAS script was then developed to directly test all main effects as well as all possible pairwise interactions, including experiment × marker(QTL) and marker(QTL) × marker(QTL) interactions.	[[154, 157], [170, 173], [184, 187]]	[]	['QTL', 'QTL', 'QTL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3975	For all traits, ANOVA was conducted to test for the effect of variation between the RILs (Line), Experiment, Flat within an Experiment (Rep(Exp)) and an interaction between Line and Experiment.	[[16, 21], [84, 87]]	[]	['ANOVA', 'RIL']	[]	PMC1976331.nxml

3992	The study of P-element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequence or TAS) has the capacity to repress in trans in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin.	[[264, 267], [123, 126]]	[]	['TAS', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3993	Here, we report that TSE displays an epigenetic transmission through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3994	We show that this silencing is highly sensitive to mutations affecting both heterochromatin formation (Su(var)205 encoding Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Su(var)3–7) and the repeat-associated small interfering RNA (or rasiRNA) silencing pathway (aubergine, homeless, armitage, and piwi).	[[217, 224]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3995	In contrast, TSE is not sensitive to mutations affecting r2d2, which is involved in the small interfering RNA (or siRNA) silencing pathway, nor is it sensitive to a mutation in loquacious, which is involved in the micro RNA (or miRNA) silencing pathway.	[[228, 233], [114, 119], [13, 16]]	[]	['miRNA', 'siRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3996	These results, taken together with the recent discovery of TAS homologous small RNAs associated to PIWI proteins, support the proposition that TSE involves a repeat-associated small interfering RNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation, which was co-opted by the P element to establish repression of its own transposition after its recent invasion of the D.	[[59, 62], [143, 146]]	[]	['TAS', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3997	Therefore, the study of TSE provides insight into the genetic properties of a germline-specific small RNA silencing pathway..	[[24, 27]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
3998	Repression of transposable elements (TEs) involves complex mechanisms that can be linked to either small RNA silencing pathways or chromatin structure modifications depending on the species and/or the TE family [1–6].	[[37, 39], [201, 203]]	[[14, 34]]	['TE', 'TE']	['transposable element']	PMC1976332.nxml
3999	Drosophila species are particularly relevant to the study of these repression mechanisms since some families of TEs are recent invaders, allowing genetic analysis to be carried out on strains with or without these TEs [7,8].	[[112, 114], [214, 216]]	[]	['TE', 'TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4000	In some cases, crossing these two types of strains induces hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of genetic abnormalities resulting from TE mobility [9,10].	[[129, 131]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4001	In the same species, strong repression of the DNA P TE, by a cellular state that has been called “P cytotype” [10], can be established by one or two telomeric P elements inserted in heterochromatic “Telomeric Associated Sequences” (TAS) at the 1A cytological site corresponding to the left end of the X chromosome [20–24].	[[232, 235], [52, 54]]	[]	['TAS', 'TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4002	We have previously shown that this P cytotype is sensitive to mutations affecting both Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) [21] and the Argonaute family member AUBERGINE [25].	[[114, 117]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4003	P repression corresponds to a new picture of TE repression shown, using an assay directly linked to transposition, to be affected by heterochromatin and small RNA silencing mutants..	[[45, 47]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4004	Indeed, a P-lacZ transgene or a single defective P element inserted in TAS can repress expression of euchromatic P-lacZ insertions in the female germline in trans, if a certain length of homology exists between telomeric and euchromatic insertions [23,26].	[[71, 74]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4005	This homology-dependent silencing phenomenon has been termed Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE) [26].	[[85, 88]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4006	Further, when TSE is not complete, variegating germline lacZ repression is observed from one egg chamber to another, suggesting a chromatin-based mechanism of repression [28].	[[14, 17]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4007	The latter study showed that most of the RNA sequences associated to these proteins derive from TEs.	[[96, 98]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4008	Here, we analyze the genetic properties of TSE and show that it has an epigenetic transmission through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted stimulating component.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4009	Further, in order to investigate the mechanism behind TSE, we performed a candidate gene analysis to identify genes whose mutations impair TSE.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4010	We found that TSE is strongly affected both by mutations in genes involved in heterochromatin formation and in the recently discovered small RNA silencing pathway called “repeat-associated small interfering RNAs” (rasiRNA) pathway [3,4,6,29].	[[214, 221], [14, 17]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4011	In contrast, we show that TSE is not sensitive to genes specific to the classical RNA interference pathway linked to small interfering RNAs (siRNA) or to the micro RNA (miRNA) pathway.	[[169, 174], [141, 146], [26, 29]]	[]	['miRNA', 'siRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4012	This suggests thus that TSE involves a rasiRNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation and that such a mechanism, working in the germline, may underlie epigenetic transmission of repression through meiosis..	[[39, 46], [24, 27]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4013	Depending on the target, TSE can be almost total (Figure 1C) or intermediate (Figure 1E and 1F).	[[25, 28]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4014	When TSE is incomplete, variegation is observed since “on” and “off” lacZ expression is seen among egg chambers: egg chambers can show strong expression (dark blue) or no expression, but intermediate repression levels are not (or very rarely) found.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4015	Simple quantification of TSE is thus possible by determining the percentage of repressed egg chambers (Figure 1F).	[[25, 28]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4016	This measure generally produces very reproducible results among replicate experiments allowing accurate quantification of TSE..	[[122, 125]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml

4019	(F) For the quantification of TSE, the number of repressed egg chambers among the first five egg chambers of a given ovariole is assayed.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4020	We have thus tested whether TSE exhibits only a maternal effect (during one generation) or maternal inheritance over several generations as well.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4021	At each generation, the percentage of TSE was measured.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4022	Figure 2 shows that in the maternal lineage, strong TSE was detected in G1 (around 70%) and maintained over generations.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4023	By contrast, in G1 of the paternal lineage, the level of TSE was weak (around 10%), a result consistent with the maternal effect previously reported.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4024	However, the level of TSE in G2 is greater than in G1 in the paternal lineage, and in succeeding generations TSE gradually increases.	[[22, 25], [109, 112]]	[]	['TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4025	In conclusion, TSE is characterized by maternal transmission that gets progressively reinforced over successive generations.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4026	Two kinds of G1 females were generated that carry the telomeric silencer P-1152 and the P-otu-lacZ transgene (P-Co1) used as a TSE target (mating schemes are shown with the complete genotypes on Figure S1).	[[127, 130]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4027	Because of the maternal effect of TSE, the first lineage (maternal lineage) corresponds to a TSE-positive context in G1, whereas the second (paternal lineage) corresponds to a TSE-negative context in G1.	[[34, 37], [93, 96], [176, 179]]	[]	['TSE', 'TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4028	This (P-1152/ + ; P-Z-target/+) genotype was maintained over generations and TSE was measured at each generation.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4029	The evolution of TSE is shown in relation to succeeding generations.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4030	First, maternally inherited telomeric transgenes may be imprinted while paternally inherited transgenes are not, and imprinting may be necessary for TSE to take place in the zygote.	[[149, 152]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4031	Second, a mother carrying telomeric transgenes may deposit an extrachromosomal factor in the oocyte, which is necessary for TSE to occur.	[[124, 127]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4032	Figure 3 shows that crossing these hemizygous females (“A” females) with males carrying a target transgene produced control G1 “B” females, which have inherited from their mother both the cytoplasm and a chromosomal copy of the telomeric silencer: in these females TSE is about 65%.	[[265, 268]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4033	However, sisters having inherited the M5 chromosome do not show any repression (“C” females, TSE = 0%).	[[93, 96]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4034	Crossing P-1152 ; P-Z-target males with females devoid of telomeric silencer produces a weak repression in the progeny (2.7%) as shown by “E” females, a result consistent with the maternal effect of TSE reported previously [27].	[[199, 202]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4035	In that case, strong repression is observed (“D” females, 75% TSE).	[[62, 65]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4036	Thus the cytoplasmic component (incapable by itself of inducing TSE, as shown with “C” females) combined to a paternally inherited telomeric silencer can establish a strong TSE.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4037	Consequently, the maternal effect of TSE cannot be attributed to a difference in imprinting between the maternally and paternally transmitted P-1152 telomeric silencers, but rather to an extrachromosomally transmitted factor likely deposited in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, which renders the telomeric silencers (paternally or maternally inherited) capable of establishing TSE..	[[37, 40], [373, 376]]	[]	['TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4038	Given the variegating phenotype of TSE and the interaction observed above between a maternally transmitted factor and the chromosomal copy of the telomeric silencer, it seemed possible that heterochromatin formation and RNA silencing could be involved in this repression.

4040	For a given assay, a P-1152 telomeric silencer was combined with a P-lacZ target expressed in the female germline, in the absence (TSE positive control) or presence of mutant alleles of the candidate gene.	[[131, 134]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml

4042	The TSE positive control produced almost 90% repression (Figure 4B), whereas one copy of the null allele Su(var)2055, corresponding to an almost completely amorphic allele, has a strong negative dominant effect on TSE (15.8% TSE remaining, Figure 4C).

4043	The allele Su(var)2054 encoding a truncated HP1 protein also behaves as a genetically null allele and also strongly impairs TSE (29.5% TSE remaining, Figure 4D).	[[44, 47], [124, 127], [135, 138]]	[]	['HP1', 'TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4044	The same analysis was performed for SU(VAR)3–7, another nonhistone heterochromatin protein that binds at centromeres and telomeres and is a partner of HP1 [33,34].	[[151, 154]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4045	Again a dose effect was observed since females heterozygous for the Su(var)3–7R2A8 null allele showed a reduced TSE (less than 40%, Table 1).	[[112, 115]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4046	Since Su(var)3–7 mutants can be homozygous viable, mutations in this gene were also tested at the homozygous state and an almost complete loss of TSE was observed (3.3% TSE remaining, Table 1).	[[146, 149], [169, 172]]	[]	['TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml

4053	miRNAs derive from hairpin RNAs and target numerous essential genes; siRNAs derive from double-strand RNAs and can serve as a defence mechanism against parasites such as viruses; and rasiRNAs derive from interactions between two complementary types of PIWI-interacting RNAs and have numerous targets but are more specific of TEs and heterochromatic sequences [3,4,6,29].	[[183, 190], [69, 74], [325, 327]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'siRNA', 'TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4054	We tested three genes (aubergine [aub], homeless [hls], and armitage [armi]) involved in both the siRNA pathway [38,39] and the rasiRNA pathway in Drosophila ovaries [3,4,29].	[[128, 135], [98, 103]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4055	Mutations of these genes can induce defaults in siRNA-guided cleavage or in the production of rasiRNAs depending on the target of the silencing [3,39,40].	[[94, 101], [48, 53]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4056	These mutations are also responsible for disruption of embryonic axis specification linked to disturbance of microtubule polarisation, but this effect is mediated by a mechanism different from rasiRNA silencing itself [41].	[[193, 200]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4057	The first gene tested is aub, an RNA binding protein and member of the Argonaute family (Figure 4E–4H) [42].	[[25, 28]]	[]	['aub']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4058	No significant dose effect of aub was detected (Figure 4G and unpublished data), but the two heteroallelic aub mutant genotypes tested completely abolish TSE (Figure 4H; Table 1).	[[30, 33], [107, 110], [154, 157]]	[]	['aub', 'aub', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4059	The second one is hls, which encodes an RNA helicase [43].	[[18, 21]]	[]	['hls']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4060	Again no dose effect was observed (unpublished data), but a heteroallelic hls mutant genotype completely abolishes TSE (Table 1).	[[74, 77], [115, 118]]	[]	['hls', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4061	No dose effect was observed (unpublished data), but a complete loss of TSE was observed in a heteroallelic mutant context (Table 1).	[[71, 74]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4062	Finally piwi, another member of the Argonaute family [46] shown to be involved in the rasiRNA pathway [3,4,6,29,47] was tested.	[[86, 93]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4063	No dose effect on TSE was observed (unpublished data).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4064	In these combinations, piwi mutant alleles aggravate the negative effect of reduction of the dose of HP1: the single Su(var)205 mutant shows 29.5% TSE, whereas the double heterozygotes show 10.0% and 5.6% for piwi1 and piwi2 respectively (Table 1).	[[101, 104], [147, 150]]	[]	['HP1', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4065	These results indicate that the siRNA and/or the rasiRNA pathways are involved in TSE..	[[49, 56], [32, 37], [82, 85]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'siRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4066	To determine which of these two pathways is responsible for TSE, several other mutations were tested.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4067	r2d2 is involved in the siRNA, but not the rasiRNA pathway [3,50,51].	[[43, 50], [24, 29]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4068	R2D2 is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein involved in siRNA loading onto RISC [50].	[[31, 36], [66, 71]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4069	In ovaries of females homozygous for the r2d21 null allele, the siRNA pathway is severely affected, as shown by a dsRNA-initiated RISC (or RNA-induced silencing complex) assay [52].	[[114, 119], [64, 69]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4070	These ovaries show somewhat abnormal ovarioles (Figure S2), but quantification of TSE was nonetheless possible.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4071	The loss of function for r2d2 does not affect TSE (Table 1).	[[46, 49]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4072	A second protein DICER-2 (DCR-2), which combined with R2D2 is responsible for dsRNA cleavage, is also involved specifically in the siRNA pathway [53].	[[78, 83], [131, 136]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4073	The loss of function of Dcr-2 is fertile.	[[24, 29]]	[]	['Dcr-2']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4074	Unfortunately, we were not able to test the effect of a Dcr-2 mutant allele on TSE.	[[56, 61]]	[]	['Dcr-2']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4075	Finally, a mutant allele of loquacious (loqs), a dsRNA binding protein involved in the miRNA pathway was tested.	[[49, 54], [87, 92]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'miRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4076	The loqsf00791 allele corresponds to a hypomorphic allele that alters miRNA-induced silencing in all tissues where it has been tested, including ovaries [54].	[[70, 75]]	[]	['miRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4077	No effect on TSE was detected (Table 1)..	[[13, 16]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4078	In conclusion, TSE strongly depends on the function of two genes involved in heterochromatin formation and four genes involved in the rasiRNA silencing pathway but is not affected by mutations of genes involved in the siRNA or miRNA pathways..	[[227, 232], [134, 141], [218, 223], [15, 18]]	[]	['miRNA', 'rasiRNA', 'siRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4079	Our study of the regulatory mechanism of a TE that recently invaded the D.	[[43, 45]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4080	melanogaster genome allowed the discovery of a master site for establishing strong transposon repression in the germline; indeed, one or two P elements inserted in TASs are sufficient to repress the mobility of the whole P family [21].	[[164, 167]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4081	Here, we show that TSE requires genes encoding proteins involved in heterochromatin formation (including HP1, a major component of heterochromatin) and proteins involved in the rasiRNA silencing pathway.	[[105, 108], [177, 184], [19, 22]]	[]	['HP1', 'rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4082	Another TE master regulatory locus has been described in Drosophila close to the centromere of the X chromosome.	[[8, 10]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4083	This locus was further characterized as regulating together two other retrotransposons, ZAM and Idefix, and proposed as a repression center for multiple TEs, known as “COM” (Centre Organisateur de Mobilisation) [14].	[[153, 155]]	[]	['TE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4084	Repression by this locus is based on RNA silencing, but differs from TSE in that repression of gypsy, ZAM, and Idefix occurs in the somatic follicle cells of the ovary.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4085	This point is important since in somatic follicle cells, AUBERGINE, a major actor of the rasiRNA pathway, is not expressed [4].	[[89, 96]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4086	Conversely, in the germline, where TSE is active, all known components of the rasiRNA machinery (AUBERGINE, PIWI, and AGO3) are present.	[[78, 85], [35, 38]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4087	Consequently, TSE is particularly appropriate to investigate the genetic properties of a complete rasiRNA-based repression machinery..	[[98, 105], [14, 17]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4088	Here, we show that TSE exhibits a maternal memory that can be detected for six generations and has thus a partial epigenetic transmission through meiosis (Figure 2).	[[19, 22]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4089	The molecular nature of this extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor, responsible for the maternal effect, is not known at the moment but it may correspond to rasiRNAs since TAS homologous rasiRNAs have been reported (see Table S1 of [4]).	[[166, 173], [196, 203], [181, 184]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'rasiRNA', 'TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4090	In the first, which derives from the “rasiRNA positive loop model” proposed by Brennecke et al.	[[38, 45]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4091	[29], females deposit PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the oocyte produced by telomeric transgenes inserted in tandemly repeated TAS heterochromatic sequences.	[[45, 50], [130, 133]]	[]	['piRNA', 'TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4092	These piRNAs would interact in the embryo with sense RNAs produced by the telomeric transgenes and result in the production of small sense RNAs associated with AGO3, which in turn would promote the production of a new antisense piRNA, resulting in a positive feedback loop.	[[6, 11], [228, 233]]	[]	['piRNA', 'piRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4093	HP1 could play a role in heterochromatin formation, not only as a component of heterochromatin but also indirectly: indeed, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe CHP1 (a chromodomain protein) has been shown to be part of a complex that drives small RNAs to chromatin in order to modify histone H3 methylation [63].	[[154, 157]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4094	Such a role for the HP1 chromodomain protein in a similar complex could also exist in Drosophila..	[[20, 23]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4095	How can maternal memory of TSE over six generations be explained? Because of the modality of TSE transmission over several generations, it can be proposed that establishment of the hypothetical extrachromosomal component discussed above requires a number of generations to reach a sufficient concentration to establish strong repression.	[[27, 30], [93, 96]]	[]	['TSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4096	Under the “rasiRNA positive loop model” proposed by Brennecke et al.	[[11, 18]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4097	[29], when males carrying a telomeric silencer are crossed with females bearing no silencer, the cytoplasm of the oocytes would lack piRNAs homologous to the transgene.	[[133, 138]]	[]	['piRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4098	However, synthesis of these RNAs would begin in these G1 females stimulating this pathway and increasing the piRNA concentration.	[[109, 114]]	[]	['piRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4099	At each generation, females would transmit to their daughters a higher concentration of rasiRNA molecules than at the previous generation.	[[88, 95]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4100	This change in the chromatin state would stimulate the production of rasiRNAs at the locus also establishing a positive loop, i.e., reciprocal stimulation between heterochromatin formation and production of small RNAs.	[[69, 76]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4101	The TSE decision appears to be established at the cystoblast stage and stably maintained since the 15 deriving nurse cells are roughly identical in regard to their repression state.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4102	Another important point in understanding the repression mechanism is that the telomeric silencer can lack the lacZ gene, i.e., the gene repressed by TSE in the target transgene.	[[149, 152]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4103	This rules out the hypothesis that silencing of the target occurs via an interaction between rasiRNAs deriving from the telomeric silencer and the target transgene transcript; indeed, the targeted transcript in TSE corresponds to the lacZ sequence and no lacZ rasiRNAs can be produced by the silencer.	[[93, 100], [260, 267], [211, 214]]	[]	['rasiRNA', 'rasiRNA', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4104	Therefore, TSE would not occur by post-transcriptional gene silencing..	[[11, 14]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4105	First, rasiRNAs produced by the telomeric silencer would interact with nascent transcripts on the target, and this interaction could provoke a local heterochromatinization of the target [64,65].	[[7, 14]]	[]	['rasiRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4106	Indeed, telomeric silencers are themselves in a heterochromatic state due to the heterochromatic nature of the TAS [68–71].	[[111, 114]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4107	This is illustrated by a phenomenon referred to as telomeric position effect, in which a transgene inserted in TAS shows variegation in the eye for the transformation marker [72–75].	[[111, 114]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4108	Again HP1 and SU(VAR)3–7 could play a role in this trans-heterochromatinization..	[[6, 9]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4109	Drosophila telomeres can be divided into three domains with respect to chromatin structure [71]: (1) the subtelomeric cluster of heterochromatic TAS repeats [68–70] in which the tested P elements or P transgenes are inserted; (2) distal to the TAS, a telomeric retrotransposon array tandemly repeated in the same orientation [76–80], the retrotransposon array is partially euchromatic [71], and transgenes located inside this domain do not show variegation for an eye marker [81]; and (3) at the extremity of the retrotransposon array, the telomere protein cap that prevents telomere fusion and regulates telomeric retrotransposon transcription and transposition [82–85].	[[145, 148], [244, 247]]	[]	['TAS', 'TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4110	Interestingly, HP1 (Su(var)205) and SU(VAR)3–7, both implicated in TSE, are part of the cap and therefore could be required for the telomeric locus to be a silencer.	[[15, 18], [67, 70]]	[]	['HP1', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4111	In addition to the two null alleles of Su(var)205 tested here, which showed a strong effect on TSE (Table 1), we also tested a deficiency and the Su(var)2052 allele corresponding to a mutation in the chromodomain (involved in the histone H3 K9-methylated binding), which leaves the capping activity intact [85,86].	[[95, 98]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4112	The deletion of Su(var)205 as expected has a strong effect on TSE but Su(var)2052 has no effect (unpublished data).	[[62, 65]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4113	This suggests that HP1 effect can be mediated (at least partially) via its capping activity.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['HP1']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4114	Therefore, HP1 and SU(VAR)3–7 could affect the telomeric transgenes in TAS indirectly via such capping activity, for example, by affecting the localisation of the telomere inside the nucleus..	[[11, 14], [71, 74]]	[]	['HP1', 'TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4115	Finally, it could appear paradoxical that an amorphic mutant allele of the Su(var)3–9 HMT has no effect on TSE since RNA-dependent heterochromatin formation in most cases involves the histone H3 methylation transition from lysine 4 to lysine 9 to establish the link between short RNAs and formation of heterochromatin.	[[86, 89], [107, 110]]	[]	['HMT', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4116	However, this result can be explained by the fact that this HMT has been recently shown not to be responsible for histone H3 methylation on lysine 9 at Drosophila telomeres [85]; another unidentified HMT likely plays this role.	[[60, 63], [200, 203]]	[]	['HMT', 'HMT']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4117	We are therefore pursuing the candidate gene analysis in order to identify a HMT involved in TSE..	[[77, 80], [93, 96]]	[]	['HMT', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4118	Telomeric TSE appears to be a complex repression mechanism that requires genes involved in heterochromatin formation and in RNA silencing.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4119	The subtelomeric heterochromatin thus represents a piRNA producing “platform” [4] available for recent invaders of the genomes to establish their own repression.	[[51, 56]]	[]	['piRNA']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4120	The study of TSE illustrates the genetic properties of such a platform..	[[13, 16]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4121	The P-1152 insertion comes from stock number 11152 of the Bloomington Stock Center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu) and was mapped at the telomere of the X chromosome (site 1A); this stock was previously described to carry a single P-lacZ insertion in TAS [26].	[[254, 257]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml
4122	However, in our number 11152 stock, we have mapped two P-lacZ insertions in the same TAS unit and in the same orientation that might have resulted from an unequal recombination event duplicating the P-lacZ transgene.	[[85, 88]]	[]	['TAS']	[]	PMC1976332.nxml

4139	In this CCW mode, multiple rotating flagella come together to form a bundle, propelling the cell forward in a motion called “smooth swimming.” When one or more motors reverse to the clockwise (CW) direction, the bundle comes apart and the cell “tumbles” briefly, reorienting the cell in a new direction; subsequent motor switching to the CCW direction causes the cell to swim forward again.

4140	Further characterization of these novel genes revealed that they impair motility through diverse mechanisms such as disrupting signaling through phosphorelay cascades, altering concentrations of the recently appreciated cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) second messenger, and by mechanisms that have yet to be revealed.

4144	The ORF intensities from five hybridizations of the maximally diverse unselected library (Dataset S1) are used as a statistical reference to quantify the degree of enrichment or depletion after the library is exposed to a selection of interest.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['ORF']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4145	The normalized hybridization intensity value (x) of an ORF from a selection experiment is compared to the null distribution for that ORF (mean: <xn>, standard deviation: σ), by calculating a z-score: z = (x − <xn>)/σ.	[[55, 58], [133, 136]]	[]	['ORF', 'ORF']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4146	ORFs that harbor deleterious mutations during the selection will have negative z-scores (corresponding to depletion), whereas ORFs that harbor relatively favorable mutations during the selection will have positive z-scores (corresponding to enrichment).

4149	CCW flagellar rotation and the correct pattern of grooves on the surface of the flagellum are thought to drive χ-phage down the filament to the surface of the membrane, very similar to how a nut follows the grooves of a rotating bolt [25].	[[1, 3]]	[]	['CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4150	Survival of a mutant meant either the loss of its flagella, the loss of flagellar CCW rotation, or the loss of other components necessary for infection.	[[82, 85], [83, 85]]	[]	['CCW', 'CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4151	This is to be expected, since null mutations in these genes do not entirely abolish CCW flagellar rotation.	[[84, 87], [85, 87]]	[]	['CCW', 'CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4152	The only exception among the che genes is cheZ, whose z-score of +8.7 indicates a CW flagellar rotation bias and reduced susceptibility to χ-phage infection.	[[82, 84]]	[]	['CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4153	CheZ is a phosphatase of CheY, the protein whose phosphorylated state biases the flagella toward the CW direction [26,27].	[[101, 103]]	[]	['CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml

4157	Among the loci exhibiting high z-scores after χ-phage selection were the rfa and mdo gene clusters responsible for the structural assembly of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPG).

4158	Genes involved with the synthesis of LPS and OPG precursors (hldD, hldE, galU, gmhA, gmhB, and pgm) were also highly abundant after χ-phage selection.	[[37, 40], [45, 48]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4159	These findings suggested that mutations in LPS and OPG biosynthetic genes may compromise motility.	[[43, 46], [51, 54]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4160	We confirmed this expectation by creating in-frame deletions of nearly all genes involved in LPS and OPG biosynthesis and assaying the mutants for motility.	[[93, 96], [101, 104]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4161	OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming; surprisingly, however, only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors (Figures 3E and 4)..	[[105, 108]]	[]	['LPS']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml

4163	In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation (Figure 4)..	[[29, 32], [184, 187]]	[]	['LPS', 'LPS']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4164	The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and χ-phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail.	[[28, 31], [36, 39]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4165	Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [34,35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [36].	[[24, 27], [32, 35]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4166	To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS/OPG mediated repression of motility, we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants.	[[164, 167], [58, 61], [172, 175]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4167	We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants (Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway.	[[88, 91], [96, 99]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4168	The χ-phage selection results suggest that LPS and OPG are necessary for infection.	[[43, 46], [51, 54]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4169	However, since functional flagella are a prerequisite for χ-phage infection, we sought to determine whether defects in LPS and OPG affect χ-phage infection directly or whether the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression.	[[119, 122], [127, 130]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4170	To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection, we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile.	[[29, 32], [37, 40]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4171	Therefore, we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway.	[[50, 53], [57, 60]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4172	These mutants were used in an infectivity assay in which plaque-forming units (PFUs) are monitored over time to assess sensitivity to phage infection [25].	[[79, 82]]	[[57, 76]]	['PFU']	['plaque-forming unit']	PMC1976333.nxml
4173	Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to χ-phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing ΔrcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for χ-phage infection (Figures 5B-D).

4176	In a previous study, the swarming deficiency of LPS mutants had suggested an essential role for LPS in swarming behavior [41].	[[48, 51], [96, 99]]	[]	['LPS', 'LPS']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4177	To test whether such a direct role exists, we interrogated our collection of LPS and OPG mutants for swarming proficiency.	[[77, 80], [85, 88]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4178	We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing ΔrcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype (Figures 3F and S6).	[[50, 53], [27, 30]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4179	These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs-mediated repression of the flhDC operon.	[[25, 28], [33, 36]]	[]	['LPS', 'OPG']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4180	Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [43].	[[91, 94], [92, 94]]	[]	['CCW', 'CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4181	First, χ-phage infectivity assays with ΔyhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants (which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants (which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z-scores of our χ-phage selection (Figure 5E).	[[122, 125], [123, 125], [228, 230]]	[]	['CCW', 'CW', 'CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4182	These measurements revealed that indeed the flagella of ΔyhjH mutants, while not strictly locked in one direction of rotation, exhibit a strong CCW bias with a rotational switching frequency intermediate between that found in wild-type cells and in ΔcheR mutants (Figure 6B).

4185	We hypothesize that mutations partially suppressing the chemotaxis defect of ΔyhjH mutants do so by correcting the severe CCW flagellar rotation bias.	[[122, 125], [123, 125]]	[]	['CCW', 'CW']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4186	When combined in the same background, these mutations may bring the motor bias closer to the optimal operating point for chemotaxis, either by having an opposing effect on the intracellular concentration of signaling molecules known to affect motility (discussed in the next section) or by an unknown mechanism that overrides the CCW bias.

4187	Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [49].	[[205, 213]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4188	Synthesis of c-di-GMP is catalyzed by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and its degradation is regulated by phosphodiesterases (PDE).	[[13, 21], [60, 63], [121, 124]]	[[38, 57], [101, 118]]	['c-di-GMP', 'DGC', 'PDE']	['diguanylate cyclase', 'phosphodiesterase']	PMC1976333.nxml
4189	YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c-di-GMP and enhanced motility in S.	[[88, 96]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4190	Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c-di-GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of ΔyhjH (Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c-di-GMP..	[[89, 97], [210, 218]]	[]	['c-di-GMP', 'c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4191	However, a single GGDEF/EAL composite protein exhibiting concomitant DGC and PDE activities has not been reported.	[[69, 72], [77, 80]]	[]	['DGC', 'PDE']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4192	In addition, several GGDEF/EAL composite proteins were found to exhibit either DGC or PDE activity [53,54].	[[79, 82], [86, 89]]	[]	['DGC', 'PDE']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4193	Based on the known antagonistic effects of c-di-GMP on motility [52] and by following several lines of reasoning, we hypothesized the dominant enzymatic activities of the GGDEF and EAL domains in YfgF and YegE.	[[43, 51]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4194	We argue that YfgF has an active EAL domain and functions as a PDE based on three observations: (1) expression of this gene enhances motility of the ΔyhjH strain (Figure 6E); (2) the amino acid sequence of YfgF shows similarity to enzymatically active EAL domains (Figure S10); and (3) the amino acid sequence lacks a complete GGDEF motif needed for DGC activity (data not shown).	[[350, 353], [63, 66]]	[]	['DGC', 'PDE']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4195	Likewise, three observations suggest that the EAL domain in YegE is inactive and that this protein functions primarily as a DGC: (1) deletion of YegE enhances motility of the ΔyhjH strain (Figure 6F); (2) the amino acid sequence of the EAL domain in YegE is not consistent with an enzymatically active form (Figure S10); and (3) YegE contains an intact GGDEF motif (data not shown).	[[124, 127]]	[]	['DGC']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4196	Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over-expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the ΔyhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP (Figure 7).	[[173, 181]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4197	Genetic evidence suggests that the c-di-GMP second-messenger system is involved in swimming and swarming motility.	[[35, 43]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml

4199	If c-di-GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the ΔyhjH double mutant library.	[[3, 11]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4200	Alternatively, specificity in c-di-GMP signaling may be due to a number of mechanisms including spatial and temporal sequestration, microcompartmentalization, restricted production/degradation, or target modification [56]..	[[30, 38]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4201	The manner in which c-di-GMP alters motility at the molecular level is currently unknown.	[[20, 28]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4202	However, it has been reported that c-di-GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [48].	[[35, 43]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4203	It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c-di-GMP, and that the YcgR-c-di-GMP complex impairs motility through a protein–protein interaction with the flagellar motor [57].	[[79, 87], [107, 115]]	[]	['c-di-GMP', 'c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4204	In addition to its effects on swimming, we found evidence that c-di-GMP signaling also plays a role in swarming motility.	[[63, 71]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4205	We found that deletion of yfiN strongly suppresses the swarming defect of the ΔyfiR strain, indicating that yfiR is genetically upstream of yfiN, and that YfiR may regulate the DGC activity of YfiN's GGDEF output domain by interacting with the HAMP sensory input domain (Figure 7).	[[177, 180]]	[]	['DGC']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4206	Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the ΔyfiR strain (unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c-di-GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility.	[[133, 141]]	[]	['c-di-GMP']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml
4207	The observations that the ΔyhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild-type strain in swarming, while in contrast the ΔyfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c-di-GMP signaling pathways are temporally and/or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [58,59]..

4210	The cpsB gene was targeted for deletion because it has been found to be among the genes responsible for capsular polysaccharide colanic acid synthesis [80], whose expression gives LPS mutants their mucoid phenotype [37].	[[180, 183]]	[]	['LPS']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml

4212	Furthermore, LPS mutants with the ΔcpsB deletion show greater motility in soft-agar plates, indicating that capsule synthesis is partly responsible for the observed motility defect.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['LPS']	[]	PMC1976333.nxml

4226	We found that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a central regulator within the spicule circuit that modulates sex-muscle excitability under both well-fed and food-deprived conditions.	[[54, 60]]	[]	['CaMKII']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4227	elegans and Drosophila have independently linked CaMKII activity with the K+ channel function of ERG and its close relative EAG [14–16].	[[49, 55], [124, 127], [97, 100]]	[]	['CaMKII', 'EAG', 'ERG']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4228	In this study, we describe two physiological contexts in which UNC-43, the worm homolog of CaMKII, works with ERG-like and EAG K+ channels to regulate a specific muscle output.	[[91, 97], [123, 126], [110, 113]]	[]	['CaMKII', 'EAG', 'ERG']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4229	Specifically, we propose that under well-fed conditions, CaMKII/UNC-43 works redundantly with ERG-like K+ channel/UNC-103 to suppress spicule protraction in periods between mating, while under food-deprived conditions, CaMKII/UNC-43 and EAG K+ channels suppress spicule protraction via a parallel mechanism..

4234	Our complementation tests suggested that the recessive sy574 allele affects the gene unc-43, since four loss-of-function (lf) unc-43 alleles did not complement the sy574 phenotype (Table 2).	[[122, 124]]	[[104, 120]]	['lf']	['loss-of-function']	PMC1976334.nxml

4243	Work by others using antibodies to rat CaMKII showed that in hermaphrodites, CaMKII/UNC-43 is broadly expressed in neurons, muscles, and intestines [16].	[[39, 45]]	[]	['CaMKII']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4244	To determine if unc-43 is expressed in the male spicule circuit, we PCR-amplified an 11-kb region upstream of the unc-43 start codon, ligated the PCR fragment to the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) gene, and injected the ligation product into C.

4247	Since CaMKII/unc-43 appears to regulate sex-muscle output via a separate mechanism than ERG-like K+ channel/unc-103, we asked if unc-103 also acts in muscles.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['ERG']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4248	Thus, similar to CaMKII/unc-43, ERG-like K+ channel/unc-103 acts in muscles to regulate spicule protraction, and unlike hermaphrodite egg-laying behavior, specific unc-103 isoforms are not essential for regulation..	[[32, 35]]	[]	['ERG']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml
4249	Interestingly, although both CaMKII/UNC-43 and ERG-like K+ channel/UNC-103 act in muscles, the functional expression of unc-43 in regulating spicule muscle contraction is not as restricted as unc-103.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['ERG']	[]	PMC1976334.nxml

4251	Based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and recent results in theoretical computer science, we present a novel algorithm that, applied on genomewide data, selects small subsets of SNPs (PCA-correlated SNPs) to reproduce the structure found by PCA on the complete dataset, without use of ancestry information.	[[40, 43], [192, 195], [249, 252]]	[]	['PCA', 'PCA', 'PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4252	Evaluating our method on a previously described dataset (10,805 SNPs, 11 populations), we demonstrate that a very small set of PCA-correlated SNPs can be effectively employed to assign individuals to particular continents or populations, using a simple clustering algorithm.	[[127, 130]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4253	We validate our methods on the HapMap populations and achieve perfect intercontinental differentiation with 14 PCA-correlated SNPs.	[[111, 114]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4254	The Chinese and Japanese populations can be easily differentiated using less than 100 PCA-correlated SNPs ascertained after evaluating 1.7 million SNPs from HapMap.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4255	However, we manage to identify a general set of 50 PCA-correlated SNPs that effectively assigns individuals to one of nine different populations.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4256	Analyzing a Puerto Rican dataset (192 individuals, 7,257 SNPs), we show that PCA-correlated SNPs can be used to successfully predict structure and ancestry proportions.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4257	Recently, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a classical nonparametric linear dimensionality reduction technique, is regaining favor for uncovering population structure.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4258	Here, we describe the theory of our method and its derivation from PCA, and evaluate it extensively on a previously described dataset of 255 individuals from 11 populations typed for 10,805 autosomal SNPs [36].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4259	First, we infer the structure of the dataset using PCA followed by a standard clustering algorithm (k-means).	[[51, 54]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4260	We demonstrate that our algorithm for selecting structure informative SNPs always converges to the results of applying PCA and the clustering algorithm on the full dataset, while achieving almost 99% genotyping savings.	[[119, 122]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4261	Furthermore, using data from nine indigenous populations, we manage to ascertain a global panel of PCA-correlated SNPs that accurately assigns individuals to their population of origin.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4262	In genetics, given a large number of genetic markers (e.g., thousands of SNPs) for a large number of individuals, PCA and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) have been used in order to infer population structure.	[[114, 117], [156, 159]]	[]	['PCA', 'SVD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4263	We note here that SVD is the fundamental algorithmic and mathematical component of PCA; indeed, PCA is equivalent to computing the SVD of a distance matrix representing the data..	[[83, 86], [96, 99], [18, 21], [131, 134]]	[]	['PCA', 'PCA', 'SVD', 'SVD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4264	(See Methods for more details on our encoding of the data.) The SVD of this m × n matrix A returns m pairwise orthonormal vectors ui, n pairwise orthonormal vectors vi, and m nonnegative singular values σi.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['SVD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4265	The selected SNPs will be chosen to correlate with the top principal components, and thus we will call them PCA-correlated SNPs..	[[108, 111]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4266	Surprisingly, the SVD immediately suggests such SNPs.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['SVD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4267	Our PCA-based algorithm does not operate on matrices with missing entries.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4268	(See Methods for details on encoding and handling of missing entries.) After selecting a subset of either PCA-correlated SNPs or high-In SNPs, we employed the procedure described above to determine the number of significant principal components for the selected subset, and we used these components in the subsequent analysis..	[[106, 109]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4269	As discussed later in this report, PCA will recognize much finer resolution than broad intercontinental clustering.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4270	We then compared individual assignment to a cluster to actual membership to a continent and found that PCA and k-means achieved perfect clustering of individuals to different continents using all available SNPs (Figure 1)..	[[103, 106]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4271	Calculating the scores described in Equation 4, we selected ten to 200 PCA-correlated SNPs and repeated PCA and k-means clustering using only this small subset of SNPs.	[[71, 74], [104, 107]]	[]	['PCA', 'PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4273	As shown in Figure 1, these 30 PCA-correlated SNPs achieve close to perfect clustering of all studied subjects to their respective continents of origin (correlation coefficient between predicted and true membership to a continental cluster is 0.99)..	[[31, 34]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4276	We compared the efficiency of the PCA-correlated SNPs that we selected to that of a set of SNPs selected using the informativeness for assignment measure (In) [26].	[[34, 37]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4277	Again, the top ten to 200 highest-ranking In SNPs were picked and PCA and k-means was run in order to assign individuals to four continental clusters using only these subsets of SNPs (Figure 1).	[[66, 69]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4278	However, in this case, even though PCA-correlated SNPs have been selected in an entirely unsupervised manner, they perform better than high-In SNPs (Figures 1 and 2).	[[35, 38]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4279	Interestingly, there was a 53% overlap between the top PCA-correlated SNPs and SNPs ranking high for In..	[[55, 58]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4280	Analysis of the test set produced essentially the same results as in the training set, with PCA-correlated SNPs doing slightly better than In SNPs.	[[92, 95]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

[[140, 143]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4282	Both PCA-correlated SNPs and high-In SNPs perform exceptionally well and as few as 14 PCA-correlated SNPs or 20 high-In SNPs are enough to accurately cluster all samples to three distinct clusters.	[[5, 8], [86, 89]]	[]	['PCA', 'PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4284	Interestingly, PCA-correlated SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with In SNPs; see Table 1 for more details..	[[71, 73], [15, 18]]	[[47, 69]]	['LD', 'PCA']	['linkage disequilibrium']	PMC1988848.nxml

4287	Once more, we observed high overlap and LD between PCA-correlated and high-In SNPs (Table 1)..	[[40, 42], [51, 54]]	[]	['LD', 'PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4288	The correlation coefficient between the actual membership of each individual to one of the two samples and the predicted membership using PCA on all SNPs and k-means is 0.9.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4289	Analysis with small subsets of informative markers (ten high-In or 20 PCA-correlated SNPs) quickly converges to the results of analyzing the full dataset.	[[70, 73]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4290	PCA-correlated SNPs and high-In SNPs have an overlap of 27.5% and are also in LD, although slightly less than what we observed in other geographic regions (Table 1)..	[[78, 80]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4291	Again, the top PCA-correlated and the highest-In SNPs perform exceptionally well for the inference of population structure in these continents.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4292	For the Asian populations, as few as ten PCA-correlated SNPs are required for almost perfect assignment, whereas a greater number of high-In SNPs is required (about 80 SNPs for convergence to 1).	[[41, 44]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4302	In a similar fashion, it seems that neither PCA-correlated SNPs nor high-In SNPs for intercontinental clustering can resolve the population structure within continents any better than randomly chosen SNPs (Figure S1).	[[44, 47]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4303	Differentiation among the Asian populations studied here is an exception and the correlation coefficient between actual and predicted membership exceeds 0.9 when studying 60 or more PCA-correlated SNPs that were ascertained for intercontinental clustering.

4304	In this case, the overlap between PCA-correlated SNPs selected for differentiation within the three Asian populations that we studied and intercontinental clustering is somewhat high (9%)..	[[34, 37]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4318	Finally, we cross-validated these findings by applying the panel of PCA-correlated SNPs that we selected on the Puerto Rican A dataset to infer individual ancestry in the Puerto Rican B dataset.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4325	As we have shown here, analyzing two independent Puerto Rican datasets, PCA-correlated SNPs can be successfully used to reproduce the structure of admixed populations and predict the ancestry proportions of the studied individuals.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4326	However, analyzing jointly nine populations from around the world and 9,160 SNPs, we showed that using 50 PCA-correlated SNPs we can assign the studied individuals with 100% accuracy to their population of origin.	[[106, 109]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4327	One reason underlying the success of our approach may be the fact that it has been explicitly designed to converge to the results of PCA, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, this argument does not necessarily apply to In.	[[133, 136]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4328	We have not dealt with the effect of local LD on the results of our algorithm and PCA in general.	[[43, 45], [82, 85]]	[]	['LD', 'PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4329	However, as SNP scans become denser, local LD will become a prominent feature of a dataset and we are currently working to see how this affects PCA.	[[43, 45]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4330	At the same time, since our method is not allele frequency based, it is possible that we are able to pick up global correlations among SNPs and haplotype patterns, and more research is necessary to clarify the relationship between the output of PCA and LD..

4331	After extracting meaningful dimensions from a dataset using PCA, we pick small sets of markers that retain the information carried in the full dataset.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4332	We believe that PCA-based algorithms will prove to be an invaluable tool for geneticists in a world of complex and ever-increasing genome-wide data..	[[16, 19]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4333	Given the filled-in data matrix A, we applied SVD on A in order to compute its singular vectors and values.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['SVD']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4334	We would like to note that, from a mathematical perspective, our procedure is exactly equivalent to applying PCA on the covariance matrix AAT, which is an m × m matrix measuring the angular distance between all pairs of individuals.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4335	(From a mathematical perspective, SVD enjoys very strong optimality properties, see [65,66] for details.) After determining the number of significant principal components, k-means clustering was applied on low-dimensional data in order to split the individuals to their respective populations..

4338	Hence, we focused our analysis on predicting the relative location of each Puerto Rican subject with respect to the centroids of the European and West African populations using a small subset of PCA-correlated SNPs.	[[195, 198]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4339	We would like to emphasize that the PCA-correlated SNPs were selecting by looking only at the Puerto Rican dataset A, with no information from the European or West African populations..	[[36, 39]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4340	However, in order for our PCA-correlated SNPs algorithm to identify the appropriate correlations if exactly one principal component is kept (in which case the associated subspace is just a line), we need some normalization of the original data (e.g., mean centering).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml
4341	In Figure S2, we show that as more PCA-correlated SNPs are picked, we can approximately identify the number of principal components that were significant in the original dataset..	[[35, 38]]	[]	['PCA']	[]	PMC1988848.nxml

4349	Micromanipulation methods [9] have allowed isolation of cells identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 16S rRNA gene probes, allowing specific microbes to be selected and increasing the confidence of asserting the presence of single cells in MDA reactions.	[[262, 265]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4350	MDA suffers from two unwanted characteristics: (1) nonspecific synthesis [3–5,8] coming from either DNA contamination competing with the intended template or endogenously generated DNA such as primer dimers, and (2) uneven representation of the template due to amplification bias [4,5] that is worsened by stochastic effects of MDA from a single copy of the genome.	[[328, 331]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4351	In the initial report of MDA from a single bacterial cell [7], an estimated 70% of DNA synthesis was nonspecific and, of the 30% that was specific to the cell isolated, amplification bias ranged over several orders of magnitude.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4352	A recent study using a combination of MDA and rolling circle amplification showed single-molecule amplification of circular 7-kb DNA templates, and demonstrated that improved specificity could be achieved by reducing the volume of the MDA reaction [12] from the standard 50μl down to 600 nl.	[[38, 41], [235, 238]]	[]	['MDA', 'MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4353	Meticulous reagent cleaning and strict sample handling procedures can be used to make background amplification negligible in microliter MDA reactions; this enabled accurate assembly of 62% and 66% of individual Prochlorococcus genomes after conventional Sanger sequencing to depths of 3.5× and 4.7×, respectively [8].	[[136, 139]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml

4360	On a percent basis, where a value of 100% indicates that a locus is still present at one copy per genome [5] after the amplification, the loci ranged from >0.1% to 106% with coefficient of variation of 223% for the twelve 50-μl MDA reactions and 21% to 80% and 16% to 77%, with coefficient of variation of 88% and 135%, respectively, for the two microfluidic MDA reaction sets (Figure 3D)..

4363	As pointed out above, the 60-nl MDA and subsequent MDA up to a final volume of 50 μl gives a net amplification of 109–1010-fold, just as for the single 50-μl standard reactions.	[[32, 35], [51, 54]]	[]	['MDA', 'MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4364	The average of the ten loci for the two sets of 60-nl MDA reactions was 0.47 and 0.38 copies per genome, respectively, indicating that approximately 47% and 38% of the amplified DNA was specifically derived from the E.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4365	This was consistent with a previous report of 30% for standard 50-μl MDA reactions [7]..	[[69, 72]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4366	In order to measure the specificity of the amplification, large-scale pyrosequencing was performed on the two best single-cell amplicons from each method (Figure 3, dashed lines), based on their performance in the qPCR assays.	[[214, 218]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4367	In the qPCR assays, these had loci representations, averaged over all ten loci tested, of 80% for the 60-nl microfluidic MDA reactions and 88% for the 50-μl control reaction.	[[121, 124], [7, 11]]	[]	['MDA', 'qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4368	When these samples were used in pyrosequencing, the nanoliter MDA sample produced 97,470 usable reads, totaling 9,833,093 bases, and the microliter MDA sample produced 114,551 usable reads, totaling 11,518,280 bases, each sample being processed on one half of a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer 20 picotiter plate.	[[62, 65], [148, 151]]	[]	['MDA', 'MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4369	This level is reasonably consistent with the qPCR analysis (Figure 3), which estimated that about 80% and 88% of DNA was specific for the 60-nl and 50-μl reactions, respectively, but was based on the average of only ten loci.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4370	The qPCR reactions provide a useful quality-control assay prior to sequencing, as well as testing the relative performance between different reaction conditions, such as two volumes (Figure 3).	[[4, 8]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4371	Even for novel microbes, qPCR quality-control assays based on 16S rDNA sequences or other initially identified loci can be used to assure a high level of success in subsequent sequencing efforts.	[[25, 29]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4372	If so, the combination of MDA and emulsion PCR sample preparation will be a particularly powerful approach to single-cell sequencing applications.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4373	The extremely high level of specificity bodes well for use of MDA in sequencing novel organisms.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4374	Since the microliter sample was prescreened by qPCR to assure relatively low amplification bias, and was therefore not a representative sample, it is not surprising that its performance was comparable to the nanoliter sample..	[[47, 51]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4375	The amplification bias created by MDA [4,5,7,14] can account for this discrepancy.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4376	By comparison, in four regions of 454 sequencing data from a non-MDA sample (Erythrobacter litoralis), the standard deviation of counts among ten segments ranged from 3% to 4% of the mean value.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4377	The lower bias for sequences derived from the 60-nl MDA reaction is in agreement with the qPCR analysis, which also indicated that lower reaction volume reduces bias (Figure 3)..	[[52, 55], [90, 94]]	[]	['MDA', 'qPCR']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml
4378	The MDA reaction is known to generate DNA chimeras.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['MDA']	[]	PMC1988849.nxml

4388	Our first step towards a global identification of hypermethylation-dependent gene expression changes was made by comparing, in a genome-wide expression array-based approach, wild-type HCT116 CRC cells with isogenic partner cells carrying individual and combinatorial genetic deletions of two major human DNA methyltransferases (Figure 1A) [14].	[[191, 194]]	[]	['CRC']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4389	Importantly, in the DNMT1(−/−)DNMT3B(−/−) double knockout (DKO) HCT116 cells, which have virtually complete loss of global 5-methylcytosine, all previously individually examined hypermethylated genes lacking basal expression in wild-type cells undergo promoter demethylation with concomitant gene re-expression [10,14–16].

4401	The characteristic spike of hypermethylated genes defined by treatment of cells with DAC or TSA consists of two tiers, with distinct features.	[[85, 88], [92, 95]]	[]	['DAC', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4402	The top tier of genes was identified as a zone in which gene expression did not increase with TSA (<1.4 fold) and displayed no detectable expression in wild-type cells, but increased greater than 2-fold with DAC treatment.	[[208, 211], [94, 97]]	[]	['DAC', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4403	The next tier of genes was identified as a cluster of genes for which expression changes of TSA and wild type were identical to those in the top tier, but increased between 1.4-fold and 2-fold with DAC treatment.	[[198, 201], [92, 95]]	[]	['DAC', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4404	Gene expression validation by RT-PCR and MSP indicated a validation frequency of 91% for top-tier genes in HCT116 cells, including genes that increased in DKO cells by greater than 2-fold.	[[155, 158], [41, 44], [30, 36]]	[]	['DKO', 'MSP', 'RT-PCR']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml

4406	For densely hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactive genes, the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) has a well established capacity to induce gene re-expression [19,20].	[[118, 121]]	[[94, 116]]	['DAC']	['5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine']	PMC1988850.nxml
4407	On the other hand, for these same genes, the class I and II histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) will not alone induce reexpression [10,21].	[[107, 110]]	[]	['TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4408	We now use this lack of TSA response for such genes to provide a new informatics filter to identify the majority of DNA hypermethylated genes in cancer.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4409	After treatment of HCT116 cells with either DAC or TSA (Figure 1C), we identified a zone in which gene expression did not increase with TSA (<1.4-fold) and displayed no detectable expression in mock-treated cells.	[[44, 47], [51, 54], [136, 139]]	[]	['DAC', 'TSA', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4410	Within this zone, we observed a characteristic spike of DAC-induced gene expression that virtually completely encompasses the genes with increased expression in DKO cells (compare yellow spots in Figure 1D with blue spots in Figure 1B).	[[56, 59], [161, 164]]	[]	['DAC', 'DKO']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4411	This gene spike is absolutely dependent upon analysis of only genes that fail to respond to histone deacetylase inhibition, underscored by a cluster analysis that shows the close relationship between genes in DKO- and DAC-treated cells with a separate grouping of gene-expression changes after TSA treatment alone or in single knockouts (Figure 1E).	[[218, 221], [209, 212], [294, 297]]	[]	['DAC', 'DKO', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4412	These data confirm previous studies covering much less of the genome, and using only treatment of cells with DAC and TSA together, in which genes with dense CpG islands that were reexpressed by TSA harbored only partial or no detectable hypermethylation [10,21]..	[[109, 112], [117, 120], [194, 197]]	[]	['DAC', 'TSA', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4413	Importantly, a similar spike of gene expression increases could be seen in five additional human CRC cell lines, SW480, CaCO2, RKO, HT29, and COLO320 (Figure 2A), as well as cell lines derived from lung, breast, ovary, kidney, and brain (unpublished data), confirming that this approach works universally in cancer cell lines and identifies overlapping gene sets (Figure 2C).	[[97, 100]]	[]	['CRC']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4414	However, it is important to note that—possibly because DAC incorporates into the DNA of dividing cells, and our treatments were performed for only 96 h—sensitivity for detecting the gene increases in the pharmacological approach is reduced in HCT116 cells compared to that seen in DKO cells (Figure 1D).

4415	To address the sensitivity with which our new array approach identifies CpG island hypermethylated genes, we first examined 11 genes known to be hypermethylated, completely silenced and reexpressed after DAC treatment in HCT116 cells (Figure 3A).	[[204, 207]]	[]	['DAC']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4416	All tested genes remained within the TSA nonresponsive zone (Figure 3B), and the direction of expression changes correlated well in DAC treated and DKO cells (Figure 3C).	[[132, 135], [148, 151], [37, 40]]	[]	['DAC', 'DKO', 'TSA']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4417	Importantly, for the DAC increase, five of the guide genes (45%) increased 2-fold or more and three more genes, or a total of 73%, increased 1.3-fold or more (Figure 3D).	[[21, 24]]	[]	['DAC']	[]	PMC1988850.nxml
4418	Based on the sensitivity differences observed between DKO- and DAC -induced gene increases (compare Figure 1B and D; also Figure 3B and 3C) and behavior of the guide genes in the array platform, we designated, within the TSA-negative zone, a top tier (2-fold increase or above) and a next tier of genes (increasing between 1.4- and 2-fold) to identify hypermethylated cancer genes (Figure 2B).

4472	Analyzing the predicted target genes with respect to the GO categories we found Ath5 among the transcription factors, in agreement with its autoregulatory function, as well as a number of factors that have been implicated to function in RGC differentiation, including Brn3C (POU4F3, Figure 3A), Gfi-1 (GFI1, Figure 3D), Irx5 (IRX5, Figure 3E), Dlx2 (DLX2, Figure 3H), Dlx1 (DLX1), and Tbx2 (TBX2 Figure 3K) [26].

4506	Figure 1 shows the effects of failing to account for unmodeled factors in a differential expression analysis, and the potential benefits of the SVA approach.	[[144, 147]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4507	However, employing SVA in these studies produces operating characteristics nearly equivalent to what one would obtain with no EH at all..	[[126, 128], [19, 22]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4508	One thousand gene expression datasets containing EH were simulated, tested, and ranked for differential expression as detailed in Simulated Examples..	[[49, 51]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4509	Results are shown for analyses that ignore expression heterogeneity (Unadjusted), take expression heterogeneity into account by SVA (Adjusted), and for simulated data unaffected by expression heterogeneity (Ideal)..	[[128, 131]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml

4511	It can be seen that the SVA-adjusted analysis provides correctly distributed null p-values, whereas the unadjusted analysis does not due to EH..	[[140, 142], [24, 27]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4512	(C) A plot of expected true positives versus FDR for the SVA-adjusted (solid) and -unadjusted (dashed) analyses.	[[45, 48], [57, 60]]	[]	['FDR', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4513	The SVA-adjusted analysis shows increased power to detect true differential expression..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4514	We apply SVA to three distinct expression studies [7,21,22], where each study contains clear patterns of EH (Figure S1).	[[105, 107], [9, 12]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4515	We show that SVA is able to accurately identify and estimate the impact of unmodeled factors in each type of study, using only the expression data itself.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4516	We further show that SVA improves accuracy and consistency in detecting differential expression.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4517	These results indicate that EH is prevalent across a range of studies and that SVA can be used to capture and account for these patterns to improve the characterization of biological signal in expression analyses..	[[28, 30], [79, 82]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4518	The SVA approach flexibly captures signatures of EH, including highly irregular patterns not following any simple model, by estimating the signatures of EH in the expression data themselves rather than attempting to estimate specific unmodeled factors such as age or gender.	[[49, 51], [153, 155], [4, 7]]	[]	['EH', 'EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4519	The SVA algorithm, described in mathematical detail in Materials and Methods, can conceptually be broken down into four basic steps: (Step 1) Remove the signal due to the primary variable(s) of interest to obtain a residual expression matrix.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4520	Apply a decomposition to the residual expression matrix to identify signatures of EH in terms of an orthogonal basis of singular vectors that completely reproduces these signatures.	[[82, 84]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4521	(Step 2) Identify the subset of genes driving each orthogonal signature of EH through a significance analysis of associations between the genes and the EH signatures on the residual expression matrix.	[[75, 77], [152, 154]]	[]	['EH', 'EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4522	(Step 3) For each subset of genes, build a surrogate variable based on the full EH signature of that subset in the original expression data.	[[80, 82]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4523	The four-step procedure is necessary both to ensure that the surrogate variables indeed estimate EH and not the signal from the primary variable (Step 1), to ensure an accurate estimate of each surrogate variable by identifying the specific subset of genes driving each EH signature (Step 2), to allow for correlation between the primary variable and the surrogate variables by building the surrogate variables on the original expression data (Step 3), and to take into account the fact that a surrogate variable may have a different effect on each gene (Step 4).	[[97, 99], [270, 272]]	[]	['EH', 'EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4524	The third and fourth steps are particularly important for maintaining unbiased significance with SVA, as demonstrated below..	[[97, 100]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4525	The overall goal of SVA is to provide a more accurate and reproducible parsing of signal and noise in the analysis of an expression study when EH is present.	[[143, 145], [20, 23]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4526	We performed a simulation study to investigate the properties of SVA with respect to large-scale significance testing.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4527	Specifically, we show that the SVA algorithm (a) accurately estimates signatures of expression heterogeneity, (b) corrects the null distribution of p-values from multiple hypothesis tests, (c) improves estimation of the false discovery rate (FDR) [23,26], and (d) is robust to confounding between the primary variable and surrogate variables.	[[242, 245], [31, 34]]	[[220, 240]]	['FDR', 'SVA']	['false discovery rate']	PMC1994707.nxml
4528	We chose a liberal adaptive cutoff for determining the number of genes affected by each orthogonal EH signal to avoid overfitting.	[[99, 101]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4529	The SVA algorithm correctly identifies the genes affected by the unmodeled factor.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4530	The dependence across genes induced by EH can result in major fluctuations and bias in the p-values for the null genes for any single expression study, even in a well designed, randomized study.	[[39, 41]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4531	By applying the SVA algorithm to adjust the significance analysis, the p-values from the null genes for any single experiment are now corrected toward the Uniform distribution.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4532	This can be seen when SVA is applied to these same nine datasets in Figure S3 and across all 1,000 simulated datasets in Figure 1B.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4533	Figure 1B shows that the null p-values consistently follow the Uniform distribution when SVA is applied, but they consistently do not follow the Uniform in a typical unadjusted analysis.	[[89, 92]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4534	To confirm that SVA is robust to the distribution of the gene specific error, we ran a second independent simulation study where the residuals were drawn from a published microarray study (Materials and Methods).	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4535	Figure S4 shows that behavior of the null p-values is corrected by SVA, which is qualitatively the same as in the case of purely simulated data..	[[67, 70]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4536	Although, note that power versus FDR is calculated in Figure 1C when we know the correct answers, which clearly will not be reflected in actual studies where an unadjusted analysis produces an incorrect set of null p-values.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4537	Therefore, the application of SVA can result in empirical increases or decreases in power, depending on whether the null p-values are spuriously pushed towards zero or one, even though SVA tends to only provide increases in the true power..	[[30, 33], [185, 188]]	[]	['SVA', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4538	Perhaps most importantly, SVA also results in a more powerful and reproducible ranking of genes for differential expression.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4539	This can be seen in Figures 1A and S5; SVA-adjusted analyses provide gene rankings comparable to the scenario where there is no heterogeneity, whereas an unadjusted analysis allows for incorrect and highly variable gene rankings.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4540	This is arguably the most important feature of SVA, since an accurate and reproducible gene ranking is key for making biological inference when only a subset of genes will be selected for future study.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4541	In other words, these results suggest that SVA would yield results reproducible on the level that we would expect given that the primary variable is the only source of signal..	[[43, 46]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4542	Large-scale dependence has been shown to be particularly problematic for estimating FDR, as dependence across genes increases the variance of most standard FDR estimators [1,2,29–35].	[[84, 87], [156, 159]]	[]	['FDR', 'FDR']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4543	EH represents large-scale dependence across genes that may significantly affect estimates of the FDR and related measures.	[[97, 100]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4544	To evaluate the potential impact of SVA in this situation, we performed a simulation study as described above.	[[36, 39]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4545	Furthermore, the behavior of the SVA-adjusted FDR estimates is almost identical to the behavior under the scenario with no EH..	[[123, 125], [46, 49], [33, 36]]	[]	['EH', 'FDR', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4546	To assess the accuracy of the SVA algorithm in the case where the primary variable and unmodeled factors are heavily correlated, we performed a second simulation study.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4547	Thus, SVA accurately estimates the unobserved factor even when there is strong dependence between the primary and unobserved factors, with a subset of genes affected by both.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4548	It was shown that many gene expression traits are cis-linking, i.e., the quantitative trait locus (QTL) linkage peak coincided with the physical location of the open reading frame for the expression trait [36].	[[99, 102]]	[[73, 97]]	['QTL']	['quantitative trait locus']	PMC1994707.nxml
4549	These pivotal loci act as a major source of EH, regardless of whether genotypes have been measured in an expression study..	[[44, 46]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4550	[10,21] dataset was used to show that well-defined EH exists in actual studies and that SVA can properly capture and incorporate this EH structure into the statistical analysis of measured variables of interest.	[[51, 53], [134, 136], [88, 91]]	[]	['EH', 'EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4551	First, we analyzed the full dataset to identify the expression traits under the influence of these pivotal trans-acting loci, as well as the patterns of EH induced by these loci.	[[153, 155]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4552	Then we applied SVA to only the expression data, ignoring the genotype data to identify relevant surrogate variables capturing EH.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4553	In other words, SVA was able to capture and remove the effects of these few pivotal loci without the need for genotypes..	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4554	In the SVA-adjusted analysis, the majority of the trans-linkages to the pivotal loci have been eliminated (Figure 3B).	[[7, 10]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4555	The reduction in trans-linkage to these loci in the SVA-adjusted significance analysis indicates that SVA effectively captures genetic EH..	[[135, 137], [52, 55], [102, 105]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4556	(A) A plot of significant linkage peaks (p-value < 1e−7) for expression QTL in the Brem et al.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['QTL']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4557	To assess the impact of SVA on power to detect cis-linkage, we calculated linkage p-values only for markers located within three centimorgans of the open reading frame of each trait.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4558	On chromosomes without a pivotal locus (Chromosomes I, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, and XIII) the SVA-adjusted analysis finds substantially more cis-linkage signal.	[[96, 99]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4559	At an FDR cutoff of 0.05, the adjusted analysis finds 1,894 significant cis-linkages, compared with 1,604 for the unadjusted analysis.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4560	This increase is consistent across a range of FDR cutoffs (Table 1) and illustrates the potential increase in power obtained from applying SVA..	[[46, 49], [139, 142]]	[]	['FDR', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4561	We applied the SVA approach to two human studies [7,22], representing the two common human study designs: disease state and timecourse..	[[15, 18]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4562	We applied SVA and identified a single surrogate variable that appears to capture this trend (Figures 4A and S7A).	[[11, 14]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4563	The adjusted analysis finds fewer significant genes at standard FDR cutoffs (Table 1).	[[64, 67]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4564	As shown above, SVA also increases the accuracy and stability of the ordering of the significant gene lists (see Simulated Examples).	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4565	Since it is standard practice to examine only the most significant genes for further study, an SVA-adjusted analysis may result in completely distinct biological conclusions.	[[95, 98]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4566	For example, Figure S8 shows a substantial reordering of genes for significance when applying SVA, including a number of highly significant genes in an adjusted analysis that moved substantially down in ranking when SVA was applied.	[[94, 97], [216, 219]]	[]	['SVA', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4567	We then applied SVA to the expression data ignoring the tissue information.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4568	The top surrogate variable identified by SVA had a correlation of 0.86 with tissue type (Figure 4B).	[[41, 44]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4569	The SVA algorithm identified 84% of the genes as likely to be associated with the top surrogate variable, indicating pervasive signal due to tissue type, as can be directly verified.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4570	At the same cutoff, 96% of the 538 genes declared significant in the SVA-adjusted analysis were also declared significant in the tissue-adjusted analysis.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4571	That is, 116 genes were significant in the SVA-adjusted analysis that were also significant in the tissue-adjusted analysis, but were not significant in the unadjusted analysis.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4572	The first application identifies significant eigengenes by the same permutation-based algorithm as in our SVA approach.	[[106, 109]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4573	Rather than decomposing the entire expression matrix (or genotype matrix), SVA performs what could be called a “supervised factor analysis” of the expression data (Materials and Methods).	[[75, 78]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4574	Specifically, SVA decomposes the expression variation with respect to the primary variables already included in the model.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4575	It is clear that EH induces widespread dependence in expression variation across genes.	[[17, 19]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4576	It does not appear that these multiple testing procedures can solve the problem of EH at the level of generality of SVA.	[[83, 85]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4577	Figure 5 shows a histogram composed of all null p-values affected by EH from the simulation study.	[[69, 71]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4578	Without the presence of EH, these null p-values would be Uniformly distributed between zero and one.	[[24, 26]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4579	However, it is also possible to produce a set of p-values from an experiment unaffected by EH, where a subset of tests are true alternatives and have p-values pushed towards zero so that they are indistinguishable from Figure 5.	[[91, 93]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4580	In other words, by only observing the set of p-values in Figure 5, it is not possible to know whether they are all null and affected by EH, or whether they are unaffected by EH and a subset are true alternatives..	[[136, 138], [174, 176]]	[]	['EH', 'EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4581	If the original data are ignored and an adjustment for EH is applied to the p-values, then the only unbiased adjustment is to make all p-values larger so that the histogram in Figure 5 is transformed to a flat, Uniformly distributed histogram.	[[55, 57]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4582	Therefore, if one adjusts for EH based only on p-values, then all p-value histograms that look like Figure 5 should be made flat.	[[30, 32]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4583	By producing datasets with stronger EH, it is possible to produce histograms where the p-values are pushed even more strongly towards zero because of the stronger dependence.	[[36, 38]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4584	This argument shows that any method that adjusts for EH in general at the level of p-values must make all p-value histograms Uniformly distributed.	[[53, 55]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4585	Therefore, it does not appear that one can generally adjust for EH based only on p-values or test-statistics, especially when considering examples such as that in Figure 5.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4586	Additionally, methods that adjust for what is typically defined as multiple testing dependence do not usually take into account the fact that the sources of dependence may have signal that overlaps with the primary variables of interest, whereas SVA does.	[[246, 249]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4587	Here we have introduced a new method, SVA, for identifying, estimating, and incorporating sources of EH in an expression analysis.	[[101, 103], [38, 41]]	[]	['EH', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4588	Simulations show that SVA accurately detects expression heterogeneity and improves significance analyses.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4589	We performed SVA on experiments involving recombinant inbred lines, individuals of varying disease state, and expression measured over time to illustrate the broad range of studies on which SVA can be applied.	[[13, 16], [190, 193]]	[]	['SVA', 'SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4590	One advantage of the SVA approach is the ability to disentangle correlated and overlapping differential expression signals.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4591	We have implemented SVA in an open source package available for downloading at http://www.genomine.org/sva/..	[[20, 23]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4592	The SVA algorithm identified 14 significant surrogate variables from the expression data.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4593	We performed both an unadjusted and an SVA-adjusted linkage analysis for each expression trait.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4594	It is not possible in general to directly estimate the unmodeled gℓ, and SVA does not attempt to do so.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4595	Thus, we can bypass the need to know what the most relevant model of a measured variable is for gℓj for the purposes of estimating the EH..	[[135, 137]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4596	The goal of the SVA algorithm is therefore to identify and estimate the surrogate variables, hk , = (hk1,...,hkn)T, based on certain consistent patterns of expression variation.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4597	The SVA algorithm is designed to estimate surrogate variables that meet both requirements.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SVA']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml

4599	These ek are the residual eigengenes and represent orthogonal residual EH signals independent of the signal due to the primary variable..	[[71, 73]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml
4600	Since  is an estimate of the number of genes associated with residual eigengene k, the reduced expression matrix represents the expression of those genes estimated to contain the EH signature represented by some hk as described above.	[[179, 181]]	[]	['EH']	[]	PMC1994707.nxml

4612	There is a genome-wide excess of high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in O.	[[89, 92]]	[[56, 86]]	['SNP']	['single nucleotide polymorphism']	PMC1994709.nxml
4613	To our knowledge this is the first genome-wide characterization of sequence variation in domesticated Asian rice, and we show that rice contains a unique pattern of excess high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that has not been reported in other species.	[[228, 231]]	[[195, 225]]	['SNP']	['single nucleotide polymorphism']	PMC1994709.nxml
4614	To assess levels and patterns of polymorphism in the rice genome, we sequenced one hundred eleven randomly chosen gene fragments (sequence-tagged sites or STS) in a diverse panel of Oryza accessions, including 72 from O.

4616	To determine if any genetic differentiation due to population structure among rice groups is evident in these STS sequences, we used the Bayesian clustering program STRUCTURE [19].	[[110, 113]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4617	Neighbor-joining analysis of the concatenated STS sequences (Figure S1) revealed two distinct clusters within cultivated rice; one comprises a tropical japonica, temperate japonica, and aromatic rice lineage, and another consists of aus and indica rice.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4618	Within-group SNP levels of cultivated rice are lower than those of the whole species (Table 1), with subpopulations harboring between 19% (temperate japonica) and 43% (indica) of the polymorphism of O.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4619	We further examined the derived site-frequency spectrum across SNPs (i.e., the fraction of derived polymorphisms present at various frequencies within a group) in indica and tropical japonica.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4620	To infer ancestral alleles for each SNP, we used as an outgroup O.	[[36, 39]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4621	sativa variety we observed a large number of high-frequency derived mutations (i.e., derived SNPs above 70% frequency in the population) leading to a U-shaped frequency distribution (Figure 2); this type of pattern has not been reported at the genomic level in any other species..	[[93, 96]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4622	To accommodate SNPs with missing data, all spectra are plotted as the expected site frequency spectrum in a subsample of the data of size n = 16..	[[15, 18]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4623	Possible explanations for the excess of high-frequency derived SNPs in O.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4624	Using this approach, we find that 88% of our ancestral SNP calls in indica and 86% in tropical japonica matched in O.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4625	An excess of high-frequency derived SNPs is often interpreted as a result of genetic hitchhiking during recent selective sweeps [26].	[[36, 39]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4626	Because the site-frequency spectrum in rice varieties is observed from randomly selected loci, and the loci contributing high-frequency derived SNPs are distributed across the genome (Figure S4), this pattern suggests that strong linkage to positively selected mutations occurred within most of the genome.	[[144, 147]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4627	This model was conceived because it incorporates key demographic features of rice or crop domestication (e.g., bottlenecks, two domestication events) and could conceptually generate the observed derived SNP site frequency spectrum..	[[203, 206]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4628	As expected, the total number of SNPs in each of the three populations is predicted quite well by the model.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4629	We quantified the fit of the model to the observed data using a modified Pearson Chi-square goodness-of-fit (GOF) statistic, and found that the best-fitting complex demographic model is an excellent fit to the marginal indica (GOFI = 20.26, p = 0.72) and O.	[[109, 112]]	[[92, 107]]	['GOF']	['goodness-of-fit']	PMC1994709.nxml
4630	By integrating over the distance between the sampled locus and the unknown target of the sweep, the marginal probability, Pi, of observing a randomly chosen SNP at frequency i in a sample of n chromosomes is a function of κ, α, and q [38]: This probability can be used to calculate the composite likelihood of the data and estimate the parameters κ and α (see Materials and Methods).	[[157, 160]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4631	To compare likelihoods and determine which model best fits the data, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [41].	[[111, 114]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4632	Since SNPs in our dataset are linked, we used a composite likelihood function and simulations to assign p-values to the observed AIC statistic (see Materials and Methods)..	[[129, 132], [6, 9]]	[]	['AIC', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4633	For both rice variety groups, the AIC for the bottleneck plus sweeps model was slightly lower than for the bottleneck plus migration models (Λ = −2.26, indica; Λ = −3.28, japonica), but this difference is likely not statistically meaningful given the various assumptions made.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4634	The bottleneck plus sweeps model fits the marginal site-frequency spectrum of indica quite well (GOF = 13.86; p = 0.92), and does a slightly better job explaining the site-frequency spectrum of tropical japonica than does the complex demographic model incorporating bottlenecks plus migration (GOFsweeps + bottleneck = 31.21, p = 0.33; GOFbottlenecks + migration = 37.83; p = 0.22).

4635	Amplification and sequencing were successful for 111 fragments referred to as STS (Table S2).	[[78, 81]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4636	To assess the sequencing error rate, 18 randomly chosen STS fragments were resequenced in a single direction for four Oryza accessions.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4637	To limit the effect of correlation between SNPs due to linkage, one SNP per fragment (the SNP with the highest minor allele frequency across the entire accession set) was used in the analysis.	[[43, 46], [68, 71], [90, 93]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4638	sativa is primarily selfing, and most accessions exist as homozygotes; thus, SNP data were considered haploid for this species.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml

4640	To assess relationships among Oryza accessions, all STS fragment alignments were concatenated to form a single dataset.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4641	Perl scripts were written to assess levels of nucleotide variation (θW) and nucleotide diversity (θπ) and Tajima's D across rice groups for all STS fragments, and to calculate the frequency distributions of derived SNPs across the genome.	[[215, 218], [144, 147]]	[]	['SNP', 'STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4642	We use the sample frequencies of variable noncoding and synonymous nucleotides in the STS alignments (i.e., the site-frequency spectrum of putatively neutral SNPs) to infer the parameters of the bottleneck model.	[[158, 161], [86, 89]]	[]	['SNP', 'STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4643	The assumptions of this model include independence among SNPs, no selection, an underlying Poisson process governing mutations, and a piecewise constant population of large size amenable to modeling using diffusion approximations..	[[57, 60]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4644	The mutation rate, θ, was estimated from the number of synonymous and noncoding segregating SNPs assuming O.	[[92, 95]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4645	For ease of notation, let Sind, Sjap, and Sruf be the number of SNPs for which we could distinguish ancestral from derived alleles using the outgroup (223, 172, and 636, respectively).	[[64, 67]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4646	Let y denote the set of derived allele counts for each SNP, with y•ind, y•jap, and y•ruf referring to set of SNPs for indica, tropical japonica, and O.	[[55, 58], [109, 112]]	[]	['SNP', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4647	To account for missing data, let n refer to the number of chromosomes sequenced at each SNP, with n•ind, n•jap, and n•ruf the vector for each group (again with lengths Sind, Sjap, and Sruf, respectively).	[[88, 91]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4648	For a given demographic model discussed above (the parameters of which we collectively denote Θ), the composite likelihood function is written as where Pr(S•|Θ) is assumed to follow a Poisson probability of observing S• SNPs in a given population under the demographic model Θ assuming the population scaled mutation rate θ = 148.6 (estimated using the observed number of SNPs in O.

4650	This composite-likelihood function (like all composite-likelihood functions) must, therefore, be taken as an approximation of the true likelihood function since it ignores dependencies among SNPs due to linkage and among populations due to shared variation.	[[191, 194]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4651	To account for missing data at an arbitrary SNP k in population x, we set where Pz(Θ,Nx) is the expected proportion of SNPs at a frequency z in a sample of Nx chromosomes under the demographic model Θ, and the fraction within the summation represents the hypergeometric probability of sampling  derived alleles in a subsample of  chromosomes if the unknown frequency of the SNP were j out of Nx (summed over all possible underlying SNP frequencies, j).

4653	Because we were pooling data across 111 STS loci, we generated our expected site-frequency spectrum accordingly.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4654	Although recombination within or between STS loci will not affect the expected number of segregating sites or the expected site frequency spectrum under a neutral demographic model, it does impact the rate at which simulations will approach them.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4655	The “observed” data can be thought of as the predicted SFS in a subsample of n =16 based on the actual SNP data assuming each of the O.	[[103, 106]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4656	There were 45 observed data points (15 segregating site-frequency spectrum components multiplied by three populations), and the GOF statistic for a given population was tabulated as.	[[128, 131]]	[]	['GOF']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4657	For each dataset, we then calculated the GOF test statistic using the expected site-frequency spectrum from Figure 4 scaled to the observed number of segregating sites within each of the subpopulations.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['GOF']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4658	Unfortunately, estimation of the demographic parameters was extremely computationally intensive for each dataset; the single observed STS data point analyzed here, for example, took over a week of computer time on a dedicated 100-node computing cluster..	[[134, 137]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4659	To properly interpret differences in AIC between models, we simulated 10,000 datasets of 111 nonrecombining loci under the null hypothesis of the best-fitting neutral bottleneck model using the ms coalescent simulation program [59].	[[37, 40]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4660	For each simulated dataset, we found the maximum composite likelihoods under each model (bottleneck, bottleneck plus migration, multiple sweeps, and bottleneck plus sweeps) and calculated the AIC value.	[[192, 195]]	[]	['AIC']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml

4663	In each group, high-frequency derived SNPs occur in ten of 12 rice chromosomes.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4664	Fragments containing high-frequency derived SNPs comprise a large portion of fragments containing any variation at all in each O.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4665	In both rice groups, the sample of STS fragments used to construct the site-frequency spectrum is slightly lower than 111 due to missing data in O.	[[35, 38]]	[]	['STS']	[]	PMC1994709.nxml
4666	Despite the varied physiological roles of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), we possess only a limited knowledge of the heterogeneity underlying their functional and anatomic specializations.	[[63, 66]]	[[42, 60]]	['SMC']	['smooth muscle cell']	PMC1994710.nxml
4667	As a step toward understanding the intrinsic differences between SMCs from different anatomical locations, we used DNA microarrays to profile global gene expression patterns in 36 SMC samples from various tissues after propagation under defined conditions in cell culture.	[[65, 68], [180, 183]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4668	Finally, we sought to understand how this diversity may contribute to SMC-involving pathology.	[[70, 73]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4669	We found that a gene expression signature of the responses of vascular SMCs to serum exposure is associated with a significantly poorer prognosis in human cancers, potentially linking vascular injury response to tumor progression..	[[71, 74]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4670	Smooth muscle (SM) is a morphologically distinct tissue that mediates the contraction of hollow organs in the circulatory, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital systems.	[[15, 17]]	[]	['SM']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4671	Beyond the viscera, SM is also present in a variety of anatomical locations, such as the hair follicles, irises, and lacrimal ducts.	[[20, 22]]	[]	['SM']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4672	Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the main cell type in SM tissue and have a distinct “smooth” appearance because their sarcomeres, the units of contraction and force generation, are arranged with no specific banding pattern.	[[53, 55], [21, 24]]	[]	['SM', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4673	SMCs share many lineage-specific markers, such as smooth muscle α-actin (SM-α-actin), SM myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), SM22α, calponin, and caldesmon [1]..	[[73, 75], [86, 88], [109, 111], [73, 83]]	[[50, 63], [50, 71]]	['SM', 'SM', 'SM', 'SM-α-actin']	['smooth muscle', 'smooth muscle α-actin']	PMC1994710.nxml
4674	The differentiation of SMCs is marked by the expression of SMC-specific lineage markers and the acquisition of the contractile function.	[[23, 26], [59, 62]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4675	The discovery of common cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of these lineage markers has provided some insights into how SMC differentiation is initiated and maintained (reviewed in [2,3]).	[[129, 132]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4676	The promoters of many SMC-specific genes contain CArG [CC(A/T)6GG] boxes or CArG box–like sequences; expression of these SMC-specific genes is triggered by cooperative binding of the ubiquitous serum responsive factor (SRF) and the SMC-specific coactivator myocardin to CArG sequences [2–4].	[[22, 25], [121, 124], [232, 235], [219, 222]]	[[194, 217]]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'SRF']	['serum responsive factor']	PMC1994710.nxml
4677	Other transcription factors, such as MEF2B, P311 (also known as C5orf13), MRF2 (also known as ARID5B), and GATA4 also possess the ability to trigger SMC differentiation programs when ectopically expressed [2,5–9], but their relative contributions to the process of SMC differentiation, in comparison to SRF/myocardin, are not known.	[[149, 152], [265, 268]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4678	Also unclear are the temporal and spatial patterns in which these transcription factors act to initiate or maintain SMC differentiation programs..	[[116, 119]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4679	Although all SMCs share many morphological and molecular features, they carry out distinct functions in different organs and tissues and are, therefore, likely to vary significantly in their contractile and mechanical properties, hormonal control, physiological regulation, and pathological alterations.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4680	For example, arterial SMCs must maintain proper vascular tone to ensure adequate tissue perfusion in response to rapid fluctuations in blood volume, pressure, and tissue oxygen demands, as well as hormonal and nervous inputs [10].	[[22, 25]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4681	Gastrointestinal tract SMCs, in contrast, participate in the periodic peristalsis that facilitates food passage and, therefore, operate at an autonomous and slower pace [10].	[[23, 26]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4682	These functional differences imply that significant variations may exist in the epigenetic programs of different SMCs.	[[113, 116]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4683	Indeed, several studies have found heterogeneity among SMCs in the visceral organs [11,12], within the blood vessel wall, and in atherosclerotic lesions of the vascular wall [13–15].	[[55, 58]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4684	Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, which are terminally differentiated, mature SMCs retain their ability to undergo large-scale, reversible phenotypic modulations in response to various genetic and environmental influences [16,17].	[[86, 89]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4685	For example, the transition of vascular SMCs from the physiological quiescent (contractile) to the pathological activated (synthetic) state is associated with vascular injuries, which cause migration of SMCs into the intima, where they proliferate and produce matrix proteins [16,17].	[[40, 43], [203, 206]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4686	Blood vessels in tumors are often abnormal—they can be greatly enlarged, tortuous, and “leaky”—and the component SMCs often have abnormal morphology and sometimes fail to express the appropriate SMC differentiation marker genes [18].	[[113, 116], [195, 198]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4687	In this study, we investigated molecular details of SMC heterogeneity by systemically examining the global expression profiles of purified, cultured SMCs isolated from various organs and anatomical structures.	[[52, 55], [149, 152]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4688	We found pervasive differences among SMCs from different organs and tissues.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4689	An investigation of the gene expression program induced in vascular SMCs by serum exposure, an ex vivo model of vascular injury, identified a signature that proved to be significantly associated with prognosis in various human cancers.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4690	We confirmed that each cultured cell population consisted of SMCs, free of epithelial, endothelial, or Schwann cells, by immunofluorescent staining, using antibodies against cytokeratins (C-11, Sigma), desmin (Ab-1, NeoMarkers), glial fibrillary acid protein (ab-7, NeoMarkers), vimentin (V9, Sigma), and CD31 (Ab-2, Neomarkers or Pharmingen)..	[[61, 64]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4691	These data were submitted to the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) for further analysis.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['SMD']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4692	We established 39 primary SMC cultures from 18 different anatomic locations under identical culture conditions (see Materials and Methods).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4693	The 36 primary SMCs included cells purified from five different arteries (aorta, coronary artery, pulmonary artery, iliac artery, and umbilical artery) and four different veins (hepatic, renal, saphenous, and popliteal veins) as well as SMCs isolated from the bronchus, gastrointestinal tract (colon), female genital tract (uterus and cervix), and urinary tract (urinary bladder, ureter, and urethra) (detailed information on all SMC samples is available on the supplemental Web site).	[[15, 18], [237, 240], [430, 433]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4694	All SMCs displayed a uniform spindle shape in culture and were positive for SMC-α-actin.	[[4, 7], [76, 79]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4695	All SMC samples were also stained for endothelial cell and epithelial cell markers (CD31 and pan-keratins, respectively) to rule out contamination from other cell lineages.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4696	Three SMC samples (one from bronchus, one from colon, and one from saphenous vein) were excluded from further analyses due to significant contamination (>10%) from other cell types.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4697	To investigate how the gene expression patterns in diverse SMCs respond to a common physiological stimulus, 24 of the 36 remaining SMC samples were also cultured in low-growth media (basal media [SMBM] supplemented with only 1% serum and no additional growth factors)..	[[59, 62], [131, 134]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4698	The global expression patterns of all 60 samples (36 SMCs grown in standard-growth and 24 SMCs grown in low-growth conditions) were analyzed using cDNA microarrays, containing approximately 42,000 elements, representing 27,291 unique Unigene clusters (Build number 173, released on 28 July 2004) to generate a total of 2.6 million gene expression measurements; these measurements cover a significant portion of known genes.	[[53, 56], [90, 93]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4699	The expression data were submitted to the SMD and globally normalized so that the average LogRatio was 0 after normalization [23].	[[42, 45]]	[]	['SMD']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4700	We further analyzed the 16,352 gene elements that were expressed in at least 80% of the SMC samples.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4701	Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression patterns of all 60 samples produced consistent groupings of most SMCs according to their sites of origin (Figure 1A), suggesting that SMCs from different anatomic locations have distinct expression patterns that persist with serial passage in vitro.	[[125, 128], [194, 197]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4702	The 60 SMC samples were clustered into two large, distinct branches: a “vascular” branch contained all the cells isolated from blood vessels and airways, and a “visceral” branch contained all the cells isolated from visceral organs (colon, urinary tract, uterus, and cervix) (Figure 1A).	[[7, 10]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4703	Within the visceral branch, there were three distinct subbranches; one containing all the SMCs from the urinary tract (including ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra), one with female reproductive tract SMCs (uterus and cervix), and one subbranch of colon SMCs (Figure 1A).

4716	To assess the possible role of HOX genes in SMC topographic differentiation, we identified 63 genes encoding homeodomain transcription factors that had well-measured expression in these experiments.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4717	Hierarchical clustering of the cultured SMCs based solely on their patterns of expression of these 63 homeodomain genes recapitulated grouping of the SMCs according to their site of origin (Figure 1C, the dendrogram labeled as “all” is identical to the dendrogram from Figure 1B); the vascular and visceral groupings were also retained.	[[40, 43], [150, 153]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4718	This homeodomain gene set also successfully separated the visceral SMCs into the three previously defined subbranches: urinary tract, female reproductive tract, and colon, suggesting that this family of transcription factors may play an important role in specifying the distinct developmental programs of the SMCs..

4719	To determine the differences in molecular features between vascular and visceral SMCs, we used a supervised method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [26], to identify 3,276 unique genes (represented by 4,870 array elements), whose expression varied consistently between the 31 vascular SMCs and the 29 visceral SMCs, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.001%.

4732	Among genes preferentially expressed in vascular SMCs were many that encode proteins in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway, which affects differentiation, proliferation, migration, and the induction of extracellular matrix (ECM) production, as well as genes responsible for ECM biosynthesis and modification [27–30].

4733	The high expression of these genes in the vascular SMCs contributes to their ability to maintain the tensile strength of blood vessels through the synthesis and deposition of connective tissue proteins [31].	[[51, 54]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4734	Vascular SMCs also expressed many genes involved in inflammatory responses, suggesting an intrinsic ability of vascular SMCs to communicate with inflammatory cells to initiate and modulate the chronic inflammatory and fibroproliferative processes underlying atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases [32]..	[[9, 12], [120, 123]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4735	Vascular SMCs also expressed high levels of transcripts encoding proteins known to be involved in reciprocal signaling with adjacent endothelial cells and in the eicosanoid/prostaglandin signaling pathways that regulate vascular tone (Figure 2B, gene names shown in purple).	[[9, 12]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4736	To further search for systematic differences in molecular pathways between the two broad divisions of SMCs (vascular and visceral), we employed a gene-set enrichment analysis [33] that evaluated differential expression of predefined sets of functionally related genes within our dataset.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4737	We tested 410 gene sets (compiled from previously published expression studies of common cellular pathways and pathological states and curated by Biocarta [34] and KEGG [35]) for their enrichment in vascular or visceral SMCs.	[[220, 223]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4738	Gene sets that achieved enrichment greater than expected by chance alone were identified by permuting the vascular and visceral SMC sample labels 1,000 times.	[[128, 131]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4739	Of the ten pathway-specific gene sets with the highest normalized enrichment scores (the normalized enrichment scores for all 410 pathways are detailed in the web supplement), eight were enriched in vascular SMCs and two were enriched in visceral SMCs (Figure 2C).	[[208, 211], [247, 250]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4740	The gene sets showing enrichment in vascular SMCs were associated with inflammation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TGF-β, interleukin 1 receptor (IL1R), and chemokine receptor pathways.	[[45, 48], [114, 119]]	[]	['SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4741	Interestingly, genes of the HIF pathway [such as VEGFA, endothelin-1 (EDN1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and HIF1A] were also enriched among genes differentially expressed in vascular SMCs.	[[188, 191]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4742	To test whether an expression signature of the hypoxia response was indeed overrepresented in vascular SMCs, we used a previously obtained hypoxia-response gene signature [36] to analyze the SMC expression dataset.	[[103, 106], [191, 194]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4743	When all 60 SMC samples were arranged by hierarchical clustering based on the expression levels of all 71 genes in the common hypoxia-response gene list [36], most vascular SMCs clustered separately from visceral SMCs as a result of their relatively high expression of HIF1A and the common hypoxia-response genes (Figure 2D).	[[12, 15], [173, 176], [213, 216]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4744	All SMCs isolated from visceral organs share features of the gene expression programs that distinguish them from vascular SMCs (Figure 2B, gene names shown in black), notably including several transcription factors involved in the establishment and maintenance of SMC differentiation (MRF2 (also known as ARID5B) [9], PBX1, HoxA10, and HoxA11 [6,39,40]).	[[4, 7], [122, 125], [264, 267]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4745	Disruption of the PBX1 gene in mice leads to a general hypotrophy of many visceral organs, yet no vascular abnormalities are noted [40], in accordance with its visceral SMC-specific expression.	[[169, 172]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4746	Visceral SMCs also preferentially expressed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).	[[92, 96], [9, 12]]	[[44, 90]]	['MITF', 'SMC']	['microphthalmia-associated transcription factor']	PMC1994710.nxml
4747	In addition to its expression in melanocytes and mast cells [41], MITF has been shown to be present in uterus and other tissues [42].	[[66, 70]]	[]	['MITF']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4748	MITF can inhibit the activities of transforming growth factors (TGF-β) by binding to Smad3, a key signaling component of the TGF-β pathways [43].	[[64, 69], [125, 130]]	[]	['TGF-β', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4749	High levels of MITF may play a role in modulating the activity of the TGF-β pathway in visceral SMCs (Figure 2B), thereby promoting a functional partitioning of visceral from vascular SMCs..	[[15, 19], [96, 99], [184, 187], [70, 75]]	[]	['MITF', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4750	Visceral SMCs also preferentially expressed Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), an essential enzyme that regulates histamine levels in tissues by catalyzing its inactivation by N-methylation [44] (Figure 2B).	[[9, 12]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4751	Preferential expression of HNMT in all visceral SMCs suggests a strong, intrinsic ability of these cells to catalyze the local degradation of histamine.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4752	The difference in HNMT levels between visceral and bronchial/vascular SMCs may be at the root of the clinical observation that the respiratory and vascular system responses (hypotension, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction) are more prominent than those of the visceral organs (urinary or digestive tract) when circulating histamine levels are high as a result of systemic anaphylaxes [47].	[[70, 73]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4753	We have further confirmed the vascular- and visceral-specific expression in these SMC cells with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig 2E)..	[[124, 130], [82, 85]]	[]	['RT-PCR', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4754	In an unsupervised analysis (Figure 1A), SMCs isolated from arteries, veins, and bronchi did not segregate according to their tissue types of origin, unlike their endothelial cell counterparts, whose clustering pattern based on global gene expression closely reflected their arterial or venous origins [21].	[[41, 44]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4755	Taken together, these results show that endothelial cells have stronger intrinsic arterial versus venous gene expression programs than their SMC counterparts, suggesting that endothelial cells, instead of SMCs, are the main cellular determinants for the arterial or venous identity [48].	[[141, 144], [205, 208]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4756	Using a multi-class SAM analysis, at an FDR of 0.1%, we identified a set of 1,037 genes differentially expressed among SMCs isolated from these three distinct kinds of tissues.	[[40, 43], [20, 23], [119, 122]]	[]	['FDR', 'SAM', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4757	The distinct patterns of expression of these genes allow the hierarchical clustering of vascular SMC samples into three separate groups largely based on tissue of origin (bronchus, vein, or artery) (Figure 3A).	[[97, 100]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4758	Several arterial SMCs were grouped in the venous branch, even with this set of selected genes (Figure 3A and 3B)..	[[17, 20]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml

4761	Interactions between the immune system and vascular SMCs play important roles in the pathogenesis of many vascular diseases.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4762	Arterial SMCs, in particular, express a large set of genes that mediate these interactions—such as cytokines/chemokines (IL6, CCL8, CCL7, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL6), complement pathway (complement factor B [CFB]), and surface receptor (ICAM1) (Figure 3B)—suggesting that vascular SMCs may themselves mediate recruitment of immune cells to the vascular walls.	[[9, 12], [291, 294]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4763	Perhaps these specific molecular interactions between the immune system and arterial SMCs may contribute to the preferential occurrence of atherosclerosis in arteries..	[[85, 88]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4764	SMC samples derived from lung tissue (pulmonary artery and bronchus) expressed a common set of genes (Figure 3C), notably including the genes encoding FOXP1, a transcriptional repressor expressed in lung mesenchyme that modulates gene expression in lung tissue [49], and endothelin receptor A (EDNRA), the high-affinity receptor for EDN1, a peptide hormone that stimulates vasoconstriction and proliferation of SMCs [50]..	[[411, 414]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4765	When the global gene expression patterns of cultured SMCs isolated from urinary tract (ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra), colon, and the female reproductive tract (uterus and cervix) were hierarchically clustered, they consistently grouped into three distinct subbranches according to their anatomic origin (Figure 1A).	[[53, 56]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4766	To identify genes expressed differentially among the three subgroups of visceral SMCs, a multi-class SAM was performed.	[[101, 104], [81, 84]]	[]	['SAM', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4767	The analysis identified 3,879 genes (represented by 4,889 array elements) with an FDR of 1.5%.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['FDR']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4768	We then performed a hierarchical cluster analysis of all visceral SMCs based on expression of these genes (Figure 4A).	[[66, 69]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4769	The distinct gene expression patterns of SMCs from different visceral organs are likely to be related to the characteristic differences in the developmental fates and physiological functions unique to visceral organs..	[[41, 44]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4770	(A–D) Colon-, urinary tract-, cervix- and uterus-specific gene expression identified by a multi-class SAM analysis are shown in (A) and names of select genes are expanded in (B–E).	[[102, 105]]	[]	['SAM']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml

4772	For example, colonic SMCs expressed fibrillin-2 (Figure 4B), a component of connective tissue microfibrils that is involved in elastic fiber assembly, organization of the ECM (which allows it to influence the physical properties of connective tissue), and regulation of growth factor signaling (which allows it to also direct a broad spectrum of cellular activities) [51].	[[171, 174], [21, 24]]	[]	['ECM', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4773	The urinary tract gene cluster contained several genes that are known to be essential for the development of the renal and urinary tract systems, including the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) receptors (LIF receptor, OSM receptor, and IL6ST [52]) and their downstream signaling molecule SOCS3 (Figure 4C).	[[188, 191], [227, 230], [211, 214], [241, 244], [212, 214], [242, 244]]	[[160, 186]]	['LIF', 'LIF', 'OSM', 'OSM', 'SM', 'SM']	['leukemia inhibitory factor']	PMC1994710.nxml
4774	The activation of these receptors by their respective ligands (LIF and OSM, two members of the IL6 family) induces the interconversion between metanephros mesoderm and epithelium in the urinary tract [53,54].	[[63, 66], [71, 74], [72, 74]]	[]	['LIF', 'OSM', 'SM']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4775	Inactivation of IL6ST, a component of the functional receptors for LIF and OSM, leads to developmental defects in the kidney [53,54].	[[67, 70], [75, 78], [76, 78]]	[]	['LIF', 'OSM', 'SM']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4776	Bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) was also selectively expressed by SMCs isolated from urinary tract structures (Figure 4C).	[[28, 32], [68, 71]]	[]	['BMP4', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4777	This protein has an essential role in the inductive signal between the endodermal epithelium and mesenchyme derived from splanchnic mesoderm [55], and BMP4 haplodeficiency can lead to renal defects [56].	[[151, 155]]	[]	['BMP4']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4778	It appears, therefore, that expression of several of the genes involved in key inductive signals during urinary tract development persists beyond embryogenesis and remains a feature of locally specialized SMCs, allowing these cells to selectively detect and respond to local induction cues..	[[205, 208]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4779	We have also found components of a regulatory network consisting of FOXF1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) selectively expressed in colon and urinary tract SMCs (Figure 4D).

4781	The simultaneous presence of FOXF1, VCAM1, and HGF in colon and urinary tract SMC gene clusters (Figure 4D) suggests that their regulatory relationship may be preserved in these SMCs..	[[47, 50], [78, 81], [178, 181], [36, 41]]	[]	['HGF', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'VCAM1']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4782	In the present study, we have found that oxytocin receptor is expressed specifically in uterus SMCs but none of the other SMCs examined in this study (Figure 4E).	[[95, 98], [122, 125]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4783	Uterus SMCs also have especially high expression levels of many genes that encode the contractile machinery of SMCs, including tropomyosin 1 and 2, calponin, caldesmon 1, SM-α-actin, MYH9 myosin, heavy and light chain polypeptide, and phospholamban (Figure 4E).

4784	These genes are widely considered as cell-type lineage markers for all SMCs; indeed, expression of SM-α-actin was used in this study as a criterion to insure that all cells in our cultured samples were SMCs.

4785	The unusually high level of expression of these proteins in uterine SMCs, however, suggests not only that there are quantitative differences in the force-generating apparatus and the contractile capacities among different SMCs but also that these differences may reflect the distinct mechanical requirements of each SM cell type.	[[316, 318], [68, 71], [222, 225]]	[]	['SM', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4786	The SMCs of the adjacent cervix, which relaxes and expands during parturition, express the genes encoding the contractile apparatus at levels significantly lower than that in the uterine SMCs (Figure 4E), despite the overall similarity in the gene expression patterns of uterine and cervical SMCs (Figures 1A and 2B)..	[[4, 7], [187, 190], [292, 295]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4787	An example of this phenomenon is the phenotypic change from the quiescent “contractile” to the activated “synthetic” state of vascular SMCs associated with serum exposure.	[[135, 138]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4788	Vascular SMCs are usually shielded from the circulating blood by a layer of overlying endothelial cells.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4789	When the integrity of the endothelial cell barrier is compromised, vascular SMCs come into direct contact with all of the components of blood, including serum constituents generated by activation of the coagulation cascade.	[[76, 79]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4790	Scenarios that can lead to the exposure of vascular SMCs to serum include inflammation; injury; the development of faulty, leaky blood vessels in tumors [63]; and acute endothelial damage from balloon angioplasty [64]..	[[52, 55]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4791	We investigated the response to serum as a simple, controlled, ex vivo model of the temporal response of vascular SMCs to vascular injury induced by serum exposure.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4792	Coronary artery SMCs were first placed under replicative quiescence in DMEM media with 0.1% serum for 48 h, then exposed to fully supplemented media, DMEM with 10% serum [65], and the ensuing temporal program of gene expression was followed by analyzing samples at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h with DNA microarrays.

4797	To systemically define a gene signature reflecting the serum response of vascular SMCs, we used SAM to identify 534 unique genes (653 gene elements), with an FDR of 1%, that distinguish three serum-starved vascular SMC samples from five serum-exposed vascular SMC samples (Figure 5A).

4806	To investigate the possible contribution of the vascular SMC serum-response program in the progression and phenotypes of human cancers, we defined a quantitative “SMC serum-response score” for each sample by simply averaging the relative gene expression levels (logarithmic scale) of the 534 genes in the vascular SMC serum-response gene signature.	[[57, 60], [163, 166], [314, 317]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4807	Calculating the average expression level allowed a quantitative and unbiased determination of the activity of the SMC serum-response program, which was likely to be more stable than the expression of any particular genes in the expression program.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4808	This approach also provided a metric that could be applied to tumor samples based on their gene expression patterns to gauge the degree to which a program similar to the vascular SMC serum response was active in each tumor.	[[179, 182]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4809	We first evaluated the vascular SMC serum-response signature in a Stanford breast cancer study representing expression profiles of 85 samples containing normal breast tissues, fibroadenomas, and 78 locally advanced breast cancers with associated extensive clinical and molecular data [68].	[[32, 35]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4810	Among the vascular SMC serum-response genes, 68 genes were well measured in 80% of the breast samples and used to determine their SMC serum scores (Figure 5B).	[[19, 22], [130, 133]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4811	When we split all ductal adenocarcinoma samples based on their SMC score, 41 samples had an SMC score lower than zero while 44 samples had an SMC score higher than zero (Figure 5B).	[[63, 66], [92, 95], [142, 145]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4812	The patients with high SMC scores had significantly lower overall survival (p = 0.0063) and relapse-free survival (p = 0.0007) based on a Cox-regression model (Figure 5C)..	[[23, 26]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4813	To assess the consistency and prognostic significance of the SMC serum-response signature in an independent set of breast cancer samples, we analyzed a published data set from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), which consisted of 295 early-stage breast cancer samples (stage I and II).	[[210, 213], [61, 64]]	[]	['NKI', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4814	Of the 653 genes that comprised the vascular SMC serum-response gene cluster in our microarray dataset, 640 were also represented in the microarrays used in the NKI study.	[[161, 164], [45, 48]]	[]	['NKI', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4815	The expression of these 640 genes in the 295 breast cancer samples allowed the separation of all the tumors into two distinct groups based on the SMC serum-response score (Figure 5D).	[[146, 149]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4816	Tumors in the high SMC serum-response group were associated with poorer overall survival (p = 0.001) (Figure 5C) than those in the low SMC serum-response group, confirming the prognostic value of the serum-response gene expression program of vascular SMCs.	[[19, 22], [135, 138], [251, 254]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4817	To investigate whether an alternative model based on the SMC serum-response signature might improve predictive power, we fit a multivariate Cox model including the SMC serum score in a quantitative form.	[[57, 60], [164, 167]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4818	These curves estimated the differential contribution of the SMC serum score to the (log) relative risk in a continuous fashion (Figure 5E).	[[60, 63]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4819	The results showed a strong positive correlation between the clinical risks with the SMC scores over a wide range of SMC serum scores in which most of the data occurred.	[[85, 88], [117, 120]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4820	Similarly, this SMC serum-response signature was associated with significantly shorter survival in a separate study of ovarian cancers, separating 72 patients with advanced ovarian cancer into groups with markedly different clinical outcomes (M.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4821	To investigate their potential relationship, we calculated the scores of 295 NKI breast tumors based on the four different gene signatures (Figure 5F).	[[77, 80]]	[]	['NKI']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4822	In contrast, the SMC Serum score was highly correlated with the hypoxia response score (corr = 0.601).	[[17, 20]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4823	This result suggests that the breast cancers with an activated hypoxia response also tend to have an activated program related to the vascular SMC serum response.	[[143, 146]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4824	The vascular SMC serum response might reflect vascular injury; perhaps the hypoxia response and SMC serum response are both elevated in a subset of breast tumors with vascular abnormalities and poor tumor oxygenation.	[[13, 16], [96, 99]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4825	A similar correlation between the hypoxia and SMC serum-response signatures was observed among the breast cancer samples characterized at Stanford (Figure S2).	[[46, 49]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4826	Interestingly, although the fibroblast wound-response signature was also elicited by ex vivo serum exposure, there was only a weak correlation between the fibroblast wound-response score and SMC serum-response score in these cancers (corr = 0.268)..	[[191, 194]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4827	To test whether the vascular SMC serum response contributes anything new and useful to clinical decision making or complements previously established prognostic factors, we evaluated it in a multivariate Cox model that included other established prognostic and clinical factors in the NKI breast cancer dataset.	[[285, 288], [29, 32]]	[]	['NKI', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4828	Although it had significant prognostic value by itself, the vascular SMC serum-response signature contributed little additional predictive power when chemotherapy, ER status, tumor size, grade, angioinvasion, and age were included in the predictive model.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4829	Therefore, the prognostic information represented by the vascular SMC serum-response signature was already contained in, and perhaps functionally linked to, the classical prognostic factors (Table S1)..	[[66, 69]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4830	The aims of this study were to begin to examine how many distinct cell types are truly encompassed by the moniker “smooth muscle cell” by systematically comparing gene expression patterns in smooth muscle cells from diverse anatomical sites, and to search for links between these characteristic gene expression patterns and the differentiation, functional specialization, and contribution to pathology of SMCs.	[[405, 408]]	[[191, 209]]	['SMC']	['smooth muscle cell']	PMC1994710.nxml
4831	The results show that SMCs native to different anatomic sites have distinct, reproducible gene expression patterns that persist through many generations of ex vivo culture in standard media, suggesting that these SMCs comprise distinct differentiated cell types.	[[22, 25], [213, 216]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4832	Several biological themes emerged in our analysis of SMC gene expression.	[[53, 56]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4833	First, although important common mechanisms for regulating the expression of SMC lineage markers are shared by all SMCs [3], unique differentiation programs characteristic of SMCs at distinct anatomic sites were reflected in the pervasive differences in gene expression patterns.	[[77, 80], [115, 118], [175, 178]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4834	Several growth factors and transcription factors are able to activate SMC differentiation programs [3]; the relative importance and contribution of each growth or transcription factor may vary by SMC subtype.	[[70, 73], [196, 199]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4835	For example, the expression of vascular SMC-specific genes appears to be partially controlled by high TGF-β activity.	[[40, 43], [102, 107]]	[]	['SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4836	It is known that TGF-β can trigger SMC differentiation by activating the expression of many SMC lineage genes [71] through the TGF-β control elements present in their promoters [72].	[[35, 38], [92, 95], [17, 22], [127, 132]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'TGF-β', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4837	During blood vessel formation, TGF-β is the crucial molecular signal through which endothelial cells recruit splanchnic mesoderm cells and then induce them to differentiate into SMCs [73,74].	[[178, 181], [31, 36]]	[]	['SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4838	The relatively high level of expression of both TGF-β and its receptor may account for the characteristic biosynthetic phenotype of vascular SMCs, as many genes involved in the biosynthesis, trafficking, and modification of ECM proteins are downstream target genes of TGF-β 27].	[[224, 227], [141, 144], [48, 53], [268, 273]]	[]	['ECM', 'SMC', 'TGF-β', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4839	The preferential expression of ligands, receptors, and other signaling components of the TGF-β signaling pathway by vascular SMCs [75–77] suggests that this feature of the vascular SMC expression program might be maintained via an autocrine mechanism.	[[125, 128], [181, 184], [89, 94]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4840	In contrast, the low level of TGF-β activity in visceral SMCs, reflected in the low level of expression of TGF-β signaling pathway–related genes, suggests that their differentiation programs may be less reliant on TGF-β.	[[57, 60], [30, 35], [107, 112]]	[]	['SMC', 'TGF-β', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4841	Several visceral SMC-specific transcription factors (such as MRF2 (also known as ARID5B) and PBX1) possess the ability to trigger SMC differentiation [6,9] and are likely to contribute to the differentiation programs of these SMCs instead.	[[17, 20], [130, 133], [226, 229]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4842	This divergence of SMC subtype differentiation programs and molecular mechanisms has been found to account for differential SM–major histocompatibility complex and CRP-1 (also known as CEBPE) activation in various SMC subtypes [78,79]..	[[19, 22], [214, 217]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4843	Second, the anatomic site–specific differentiation of SMCs may help explain the particular susceptibility of specific tissues and organs to specific pathogenic processes.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4844	For example, vascular SMCs, but not visceral SMCs, express large sets of genes implicated in fibrogenic matrix deposition, tissue remodeling, hypoxia response, and inflammatory responses.	[[22, 25], [45, 48]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4845	These biological processes are implicated in pathogenesis of human diseases affecting SMCs, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and asthma.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4846	For example, the unique vulnerability of arterial SMCs to atherosclerosis may be related in part to the high levels at which they express TGF-β and the inflammatory response genes (Figure 3B), and the relatively low expression level of a group of genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis in vascular SMCs might contribute to their relative vulnerability to damage from oxidative stress [80]..	[[50, 53], [302, 305], [138, 143]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC', 'TGF-β']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4847	EDN1 receptor A mediates a contractile response to EDN1 in SMCs; the high intrinsic expression of its transcript in pulmonary artery SMCs suggests that pulmonary arteries may be especially sensitive to the vasoconstrictive activity of circulating EDN1 [82].	[[59, 62], [133, 136]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4848	The differential expression of fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2 in SMCs may be related to the anatomic specificity of diseases that result from defects of these proteins.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4849	Fibrillin 1 is expressed exclusively in vascular SMCs while fibrillin 2 is found also in colon SMCs (Figure 2B).	[[49, 52], [95, 98]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4850	Mutations in fibrillin 1 lead to Marfan's syndrome, in which major defects affect the vascular structures, in agreement with vascular SMC expression of fibrillin-1 (Figure 2B).	[[134, 137]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4851	Third, specialized gene expression programs reflecting anatomically specific differentiation may underlie the distinct mechanical properties of the SMCs in each tissue.	[[148, 151]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4852	For example, uterine SMCs express genes encoding contractile proteins and sarcomere units at especially high levels, but cervical SMCs, while otherwise very similar, do not.	[[21, 24], [130, 133]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4853	The uterus-specific expression pattern may be related to the uterus' unique need to generate contractile force during parturition and points to a uterus-specific mechanism for fine tuning expression of genes broadly expressed by cells of SMC lineage.	[[238, 241]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4854	Although SRF/myocardin levels are similar in all SMCs, variations in the expression levels of other regulators may account for these fine-tuned differences.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4855	For example, the oxytocin receptor, expressed primarily in uterus SMCs, may play such a role, given its ability to trigger muscle differentiation programs [84]..	[[66, 69]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4856	For example, the patterns of expression of a small number of HOX genes can recapitulate the same anatomic clustering of SMCs that was originally achieved with all of the genes in our study, suggesting that positional information encoded in the pattern of expression of the HOX genes may play an important role in determining the distinct molecular phenotypes of SMCs at different sites.	[[120, 123], [362, 365]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4857	The expression of the BMP4 and LIF/OSM receptor in urinary tract SMCs may be a vestige of their developmental origins and suggests the possibility that these cells may retain some of the developmental plasticity of their progenitors.	[[22, 26], [35, 38], [36, 38], [65, 68]]	[]	['BMP4', 'OSM', 'SM', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4858	Corollary to all of our findings on differential gene expression in SMCs is the idea that topographically regulated genes, which can be studied ex vivo in cultured cells, may provide an excellent starting point for dissecting the molecular pathways involved in the development of individual tissues and organs..	[[68, 71]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4859	Finally, we have found that a gene in vitro expression program elicited in vascular SMCs by short-term exposure to serum, an in vitro model of vascular injury [3], is predictive of elevated risk of progression in a variety of human carcinomas.	[[84, 87]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4860	Expression of the vascular SMC serum-response program in human carcinomas may reflect aberrant properties of the tumor vasculature, which can often have biochemical, structural, and compositional abnormalities that result in defective and leaky endothelial cells.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4861	Consistent with this possibility, tumors with a gene expression pattern resembling the SMC serum response tend to also exhibit a strong hypoxia response [36], another characteristic of tumors with defective tumor vasculature [19,85].	[[87, 90]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4862	The possibility that the SMC serum-response signature could identify patients with defective tumor blood vessels, who might benefit from the emerging cancer therapeutics that target tumor vasculature (e.g., the VEGF-specific antibody, bevacizumab), deserves further investigation [19,86,87]..	[[25, 28]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4863	The functional and regulatory specializations revealed by the global gene expression patterns of SMCs from different tissues are of particular clinical importance because SMCs are among the cells most frequently targeted by drugs—e.g., for the reduction of airway resistance, the regulation of blood pressure, or for the induction or inhibition of peristalsis, urination, or labor.	[[97, 100], [171, 174]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4864	Most current treatments affect SMCs indirectly through the autonomic nervous system, and these treatments sometimes have undesirable off-target side effects.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4865	Although this study provides only an initial survey of the molecular diversity and heterogeneity of SMCs, it is clear that the genes encoding many potentially “drugable” targets—ion channels, adhesion molecules, and G-protein signaling receptors—are selectively expressed in different SMCs.	[[100, 103], [285, 288]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml
4866	A more comprehensive study of global expression patterns in anatomically distinct SMCs is likely to uncover additional potential targets for selective SMC-directed therapeutics..	[[82, 85], [151, 154]]	[]	['SMC', 'SMC']	[]	PMC1994710.nxml

4876	As shown in Figure 1, the strongest evidence for univariate linkage for ARC was seen at 1q42.2 (250 cM, Logarithm of odds (LOD) = 2.04; point-wise p-value = .002, genome-wide p-value = .29).	[[72, 75], [123, 126]]	[[104, 121]]	['ARC', 'LOD']	['logarithm of odds']	PMC1994711.nxml
4877	At this position, the QTL explained 21% of the variance in ARC, while the multivariate test revealed low QTL factor loadings across the five fingers, explaining 7.7%, 12.7%, 10.0%, 13.8%, and 9.3% of the variation in individual counts from thumb to little finger, respectively (Figure 2A).

4923	We evaluated CpG island methylation in these MYC-induced tumors by restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS), a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that measures the DNA methylation status of about 1,500–2,000 NotI methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sites preferentially located in CpG islands [15,24].

4924	Southern blot analysis of normal and tumor samples probed with the cloned DNA fragments confirmed tumor-specific hypermethylation in 14 of the 15 RLGS loci tested (Figures 1D and S1; Table S1).	[[146, 150]]	[]	['RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4925	Bisulfite sequencing and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) assays confirmed tumor-specific methylation in regions surrounding the NotI site in 29 out of the 34 CpG islands tested (Figures 1E, S1, and S2; Table S1).

4926	As determined by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) techniques, the expression of 15 from 16 randomly selected genes was significantly decreased in tumor samples relative to normal controls (Figures 1F and S1; Table S1).	[[54, 60]]	[]	['RT-PCR']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4927	As shown in Figure 2B, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)-based cell sorting of thymocytes isolated from 21-, 31- and 42-d-old quadruple transgenic mice resulted in the efficient separation of EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative thymocytes.	[[59, 63]]	[[23, 57]]	['FACS']	['fluorescent activated cell sorting']	PMC1994712.nxml
4928	Surprisingly, the RLGS patterns of DNA methylation in three pairs of EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells derived from 21-, 31- and 42-d-old mice were identical, indicating that MYC overexpression in thymocytes is not sufficient to target hypermethylation to specific CpG islands (Figure 2D and 2E; unpublished data).

4929	The absence of aberrant promoter methylation at these early stages of disease was confirmed by gene-specific COBRA assays (Figures 2F and S3A–S3C)..	[[109, 114]]	[]	['COBRA']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4930	Thus, to evaluate CpG island methylation in a more homogenous and experimentally amenable cell system where the chronology of aberrant DNA methylation could be better evaluated during the early neoplastic process, we turned to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).	[[256, 259]]	[[227, 253]]	['MEF']	['mouse embryonic fibroblast']	PMC1994712.nxml
4931	Primary MEFs have the potential to be transformed in vitro and in vivo by the cointroduction of two oncogenes.	[[8, 11]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4932	We thus compared DNA methylation by RLGS methods in primary MEFs before and immediately after their transformation with MYC and an activated form of Ras (Ras61L).	[[60, 63], [36, 40]]	[]	['MEF', 'RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4933	This comparison of 1,635 NotI restriction sites revealed no methylation changes between control and fully transformed MYC/Ras61L-expressing cells (Figure 3A–3C), suggesting that as in EμSR-tTA;Teto-MYC mice, MYC expression and transformation of MEFs is not sufficient to target methylation to specific CpG islands.	[[245, 248]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4934	We then assessed whether signatures of CpG island methylation could be acquired or selected for when transformed MEFs are cultured for longer periods of time.	[[113, 116]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4935	DNA methylation was analyzed in MYC/Ras61L-transformed MEFs that were either cultured in vitro for several weeks or were injected into nude mice for an equivalent length of time (Figure 3A).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml

4937	These data suggest that among all Myc/Ras61L-expressing MEFs with a fully transformed phenotype, only those with a specific pattern of methylated CpG islands are favored during their in vitro or in vivo expansion.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['MEF']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml

4943	We then analyzed the pattern of CpG island methylation in each tumor cohort by RLGS (Figures 4C and 5A).	[[79, 83]]	[]	['RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4944	The aberrant DNA methylation detected in tumor samples was confirmed by 126 COBRA reactions performed on the same tumor samples that were used for RLGS analysis.	[[76, 81], [147, 151]]	[]	['COBRA', 'RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4945	This analysis revealed that in 74% of the cases evaluated, RLGS and COBRA assays yielded identical results (Figure S5 and unpublished data).	[[68, 73], [59, 63]]	[]	['COBRA', 'RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4946	In 22 % of cases COBRA detected aberrant DNA methylation events that were not identified by RLGS.	[[17, 22]]	[]	['COBRA']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml

4956	Similarly, expression of seven additional genes corresponding to RLGS fragments 2G81, 3F45, 3F56, 4B22, 1G05–06, 1D14, and 6C25 correlated well with the methylation status of CpG islands in each corresponding genetic group (Figure 4E).	[[65, 69]]	[]	['RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml
4957	The fact that our RLGS analysis identified a specific signature of CpG island methylation that could only be detected late in the MYC-induced neoplastic process suggests that MYC overexpression is insufficient to target the DNA methylation machinery to specific sites.	[[18, 22]]	[]	['RLGS']	[]	PMC1994712.nxml

5039	We used a 80 μCi (2.96 MBq) dose for 188Re-246-D and 100 μCi (3.7 MBq) for 213Bi-246-D, because these doses were therapeutic and safe in experimental RIT of fungal and bacterial infections [17,39].	[[150, 153]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5040	The 72 h time period was chosen to give the sufficient time for the 188Re-labeled mAb to deliver a lethal dose of radioactivity to the cells, as 188Re half-life is 16.9 h and several half-lives are required for a given radionuclide to deliver the dose to the target.

5042	In contrast, the administration of the matching amounts of cold 246-D (p = 1.0) or of a radioisotope-coupled irrelevant control mAb did not reduce the average number of infected cells in the SCID mouse spleens (p = 1.0 and p = 0.06 for 188Re- and 213Bi-labeled control mAb, respectively).

5053	In fact, one of the advantages of using RIT to treat infections as opposed to cancer is that, in contrast to tumor cells, cells expressing microbial antigens are antigenically very different from host tissues and thus provide the potential for exquisite specificity and low cross-reactivity.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5054	This safety profile is compatible with our previous data showing that RIT was also relatively nontoxic in mouse models of experimental fungal and bacterial infection [17,39].	[[70, 73]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5055	A large therapeutic window is available because the therapeutic effect was achieved with activities significantly lower than reported maximum tolerated activity for 188Re-labeled (800 μCi (29.6 MBq) for intravenous injection [42]) and 213Bi-labeled IgGs (in excess of 1,000 μCi (37 MBq) when given IP [42]).

5056	In this regard, IP administration of the radiolabeled mAbs utilized in our study has proved to be better tolerated than the intravenous route [42], and it helps to circumvent the problem of often relatively low specific activity of radiolabeled mAbs (in mCi/ml) by allowing the administration of higher volumes than during intravenous administration..

5058	To further examine the in vivo capacity of RIT to target and eliminate HIV-1-infected lymphocytes, we utilized our well-characterized thy/liv-SCID-hu mouse model [43–45].	[[144, 146], [43, 46]]	[]	['ID', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5059	This system uses SCID mice implanted under their kidney capsules with fetal human thymic and liver tissue that develops into a structure closely resembling a human thymus; this thymic implant is readily infectible with clinical isolates of HIV-1.	[[19, 21]]	[]	['ID']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml

5061	We have previously demonstrated that HIV-1-infected thy/liv-SCID-hu mice develop HIV plasma viremia, which may correlate with the higher uptake of 246-D in the blood as well as spleen, liver, and kidneys of the HIV-infected mice..	[[62, 64]]	[]	['ID']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml

5063	Because uptake of the radiolabeled anti-gp41 mAb in infected implants of thy/liv-SCID-hu was modest after IP injection, the therapy experiments were performed using intraimplant injections of radiolabeled mAbs to accommodate the predominantly murine vasculature of the implant, which may contribute to decreased transport of the radiolabeled antibody.

5069	We have demonstrated that the antibodies to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 labeled with radioisotopes 213Bi and 188Re selectively killed chronically HIV-1-infected human T cells and acutely HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) in vitro.	[[260, 265]]	[[218, 257]]	['hPBMC']	['human peripheral blood mononuclear cell']	PMC1630718.nxml
5070	Treatment of SCID mice harboring HIV-1-infected hPBMCs in their spleens with a 213Bi- or 188Re-labeled monoclonal antibody to gp41 viral protein resulted in a greater than 99% elimination of HIV-1-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner.	[[48, 53], [15, 17]]	[]	['hPBMC', 'ID']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5071	The number of HIV-1-infected thymocytes decreased 2.5-fold in the human thymic implant grafts of SCID mice treated with the 188Re-labeled antibody to gp41 compared with those treated with the 188Re-control mAb.	[[99, 101]]	[]	['ID']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5072	In cancer treatment, the success of FDA-approved drugs such as Zevalin and Bexxar (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with yttrium 90 [90Y] and iodine 131 [131I], respectively) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is proof of the enormous potential of RIT for targeted elimination of malignant cells and for treatment of patients who have failed all standard therapeutic regimens.

5073	Recent encouraging reports on the use of RIT as an initial treatment for follicular lymphoma [48] are making RIT a first-line anticancer therapy.	[[41, 44], [109, 112]]	[]	['RIT', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5074	This clinical experience using RIT creates a favorable environment for the introduction and use of RIT for treating HIV-1-infected patients.	[[31, 34], [99, 102]]	[]	['RIT', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5075	The effectiveness of RIT for HIV-1 infection is enhanced because the majority of long-lived infected cellular targets are lymphocytes, which are among the most radiosensitive cells in the body..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5076	Consistent with this mechanism, 188Re-labeled mAbs may be more effective in vivo than in vitro (Figures 1A and 3A).	[[46, 49]]	[]	['mAb']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5077	In this regard, beta-emitting radionuclides, which kill cells preferentially by “cross-fire” [15], have been successfully used for therapy of leukemia, a single-cell disease [49], and in preclinical RIT of systemic fungal infections [16,39,50].	[[199, 202]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5078	(4) RIT is potentially less toxic than immunotoxins, because the chemistry of linking different radioisotopes including 188Re and 213Bi to the antibodies has been well developed, and the exceptional stability of radiolabeled mAbs in vitro and in vivo has been confirmed [15,42,51].	[[225, 228], [4, 7]]	[]	['mAb', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5079	Nevertheless, combination therapy consisting of RIT and immunotoxins may provide greater advantages than either modality alone..	[[48, 51]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5080	We have recently shown that RIT of infection works through the combination of cell-killing mechanisms such as “direct hit” and “cross-fire,” promotion of apoptotic death of targeted cells, generation of reactive oxygen species and modulation of the inflammatory response [50].	[[28, 31]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5081	There are numerous published data on the existence of threshold RIT doses below which no therapeutic effects on tumors in animals are observed and above which the effects quickly reach maximum [42, 52].	[[64, 67]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5082	However, determination of the threshold doses in RIT is not considered to be of practical importance as in the clinic this therapy is administered as maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to maximize the therapeutic effect.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5083	These results establish that RIT can effectively target and kill HIV-1-infected hPBMCs in vivo..	[[80, 85], [29, 32]]	[]	['hPBMC', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5084	Based on the data accumulated in clinical RIT of cancer, the primary toxic effect of RIT applied to infections is likely to be bone marrow suppression.	[[42, 45], [85, 88]]	[]	['RIT', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5085	Nevertheless, RIT of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is effective in patients who have received several unsuccessful courses of chemotherapy and consequently have depleted bone marrow reserves and weakened immunity—not unlike some patients with advanced HIV-1 infection.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5086	The application of RIT to infectious diseases will require optimization of the dose to ascertain and minimize toxic effects..	[[19, 22]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5087	It is also extremely unlikely that particulate radiation utilized in RIT will cause mutation of the HIV virus, the genomic information of which is carried by two positive RNA strands and not by DNA, and ionizing radiation is a weak mutagen compared to chemical mutagens [56].	[[69, 72]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5088	Acutely exposed individuals lack HIV-specific antibodies that could reduce the effectiveness of RIT by competitively binding to gp41, so RIT could be used for treatment initiated after HIV exposure.	[[96, 99], [137, 140]]	[]	['RIT', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5089	If this competition occurs, it could be circumvented by increasing the RIT antibody dosage or by coupling the radionuclides to very high affinity antibodies likely to bind more effectively to the gp41 than self-antibodies.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5090	The latter approach would be enhanced by using cocktails of mAbs against noncompeting epitopes and, following the well-known radiation oncology approach of dose fractionation, each antibody in the antibody cocktail would carry a partial dose (one-half or one-third, depending on the composition of the cocktail).	[[60, 63]]	[]	['mAb']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5091	Our group is currently investigating the role of competition between radiolabeled mAb 246-D and cold polyclonal human anti-gp41 antibody binding to HIV-1 gp41 and killing HIV-1-infected cells..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['mAb']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5092	If advanced to clinical use, RIT might be most effective when used in combination with HAART [57], which blocks virus replication in newly infected cells.	[[87, 92], [29, 32]]	[]	['HAART', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5093	The major therapeutic use of RIT will likely be as an adjunct with HAART to prevent HIV infection when administered to individuals within the first days of exposure to HIV.	[[67, 72], [29, 32]]	[]	['HAART', 'RIT']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml
5094	To avoid selection of cells harboring antibody-resistant viruses, a cocktail of mAbs to various epitopes on the HIV envelope may be desirable.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['mAb']	[]	PMC1630718.nxml

5099	Mutations in this enzyme produce X-linked deficiency states associated with protection against malaria, notably in Africa where the A− form of G6PD deficiency is widespread.	[[143, 147]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5100	We conducted large case-control studies of the A− form of G6PD deficiency in cases of severe or uncomplicated malaria among two ethnic populations of rural Mali, West Africa, where malaria is hyperendemic.	[[58, 62]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5101	Our results indicate that the uniform state of G6PD deficiency in hemizygous male children conferred significant protection against severe, life-threatening malaria, and that it may have likewise protected homozygous female children.	[[47, 51]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5102	No such protection was evident from the mosaic state of G6PD deficiency in heterozygous females.	[[56, 60]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5103	We also found no significant differences in the parasite densities of males and females with differences in G6PD status.	[[108, 112]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml

5107	“Favism” is a condition that results from a deficiency in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and this disorder is thought to be the commonest enzyme-deficiency disease worldwide.	[[110, 114]]	[[75, 108]]	['G6PD']	['glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase']	PMC1820604.nxml
5108	The disease is named favism after the Italian word for broad beans (fava), which cause a classic reaction when eaten by people with G6PD deficiency.	[[132, 136]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5109	The G6PD enzyme is particularly important in red blood cells, where it protects against damage that can be caused by certain drugs or other stresses.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5110	There are a number of normal variants of G6PD, with G6PD A and G6PD B being common in Africa.	[[41, 45], [52, 56], [63, 67]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5111	Although there can be serious clinical outcomes from G6PD deficiency that result from the red blood cells being broken down, G6PD deficiency may protect against malaria..	[[53, 57], [125, 129]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5112	The researchers here wanted to find out whether, in regions where virtually all children get malaria during early childhood, a mutation in G6PD A (written as G6PD A−) that leads to G6PD deficiency protects children from having their malaria episodes worsen into severe, life-threatening disease.	[[139, 143], [158, 162], [181, 185]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5113	They also wanted to look at whether the degree of protection from G6PD A− deficiency differed between boys and girls.	[[66, 70]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5114	The reason for looking at this had to do with the genetics of G6PD deficiency.	[[62, 66]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5115	The gene coding for G6PD is carried on the X chromosome, of which males have only one copy, whereas females have two.	[[20, 24]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5116	Therefore, males will be G6PD deficient when they inherit only one mutant gene, but females need to inherit two abnormal genes (or have the normal gene turned off, which happens by a process known as X-inactivation in a proportion of female cells)..	[[25, 29]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5117	Blood samples were collected from each child in order to see how many malaria parasites were in the blood, as well as to analyze each patient's DNA to work out whether they had a mutant form of the G6PD*A gene that causes the G6PD A− form of deficiency..	[[226, 230]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5118	The researchers then looked at whether the protection given by the mutant forms of G6PD affected boys and girls differently.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5119	These data show that the mutation in G6PD*A that leads to the G6PD A− deficiency gives children substantial protection against severe malaria, but this protection seems to be the case for boys and not girls who have only one mutant copy of the gene.	[[62, 66]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5120	There seems to be around a two-thirds drop in risk of severe malaria in boys with G6PD deficiency as compared to normal boys.	[[82, 86]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5121	At present the reason for this difference in protection is not clear, because it is not known how malaria parasites are affected by red blood cells that lack G6PD activity..	[[158, 162]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5122	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is important in the generation of reduced glutathione, a product key in the control of oxidative damage in erythrocytes.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5123	Although complete loss of this enzyme is presumably lethal, mutant forms of G6PD with partially deficient activity are common and have been associated with protection against malaria.	[[76, 80]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5124	Geographic distribution of these G6PD variants correlates with historic distributions of the disease [1,2], and a mutant allele (A−) encoding G6PD with 10%–50% of normal enzyme activity is widespread in Africa [3–5].	[[33, 37], [142, 146]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5125	A report of near-equivalent protection against life-threatening malaria in both males and females [5] has also been difficult to reconcile with the differential expression of G6PD deficiency between the sexes, as hemizygous males would be expected to show an advantage over heterozygous females under at least one mechanism of protection currently advocated [11]..	[[175, 179]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5126	Following our demonstration of protection against severe relative to uncomplicated malaria by hemoglobin (Hb) C in Dogon children of Mali [13], we asked whether the A− form of G6PD deficiency might also protect against severe malaria, and whether it might do so in a sex-specific manner.

5128	Under conditions intended to eliminate risk of cross-contamination and with appropriate water-only negative controls, exon 4 of G6PD was amplified using a nested PCR protocol: 1 μg of genomic DNA was first amplified using primers 5′-GTCTTCTGGGTCAGGGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGAAAGCTCTCTCTCC-3′ (reverse).

5132	Second, in the larger village of Bandiagara contributing to the Dogon study group, we showed that the prevalence of Hb C in uncomplicated malaria patients was the same as that in more than 7,000 individuals from the overall population [13], a finding consistent with universal experience of Dogon children with parasitization and malaria.	[[116, 118]]	[]	['Hb']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5133	Since the malaria cases from that study also provided test samples for our present report, the observed prevalence of G6PD A− in our uncomplicated malaria control group likely reflects the prevalence of G6PD A− in the Dogon population at large..

5136	The A− form of G6PD deficiency in sub-Saharan Africa is a sex-linked trait characterized by two mutations in the G6PD gene-coding sequence on the X chromosome (nucleotide changes A376G, resulting in an Asn → Asp mutation, and G202A, resulting in a Val → Met mutation).	[[15, 19], [113, 117]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5137	In males with G6PD A−, all encoded copies of the enzyme are deficient because only one version of the X chromosome is present (hemizygous state).	[[14, 18]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5138	However, G6PD A− females can have either homozygous deficiency in which all encoded copies of the enzyme are deficient (because both of the two inherited X chromosomes carry the mutant allele) or, more frequently, a heterozygous, mosaic state of G6PD-deficient and G6PD-normal cells (because random inactivation of one of the two inherited X chromosomes results in some cells with normal enzyme and others with mutant enzyme).	[[9, 13], [246, 250], [265, 269]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml

5140	By stratified OR analysis of the case-control recruitments from the Dogon and Malinké-predominant groups, we found that the protection due to G6PD deficiency against severe malaria occurs entirely in males (Table 1; pooled OR = 0.42; 95% CI 0.23–0.73; p < 0.001).

5152	Our results from the Malinké and Dogon children in two regions 600 km apart show that G6PD A− provides substantial protection against severe malaria in hemizygous males but little or no protection in heterozygous females.	[[86, 90]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5153	After correcting for the confounding variables of age-dependent acquired immunity and potential effects of hemoglobins C and S, we calculate a pooled OR of 0.28 (95% CI 0.11–0.62) for the males 5 y old and below in these two groups.	[[166, 168], [150, 152]]	[]	['CI', 'OR']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5154	While our case-control design does not allow the calculation of relative risk that would be available from a prospective cohort study, the nearly complete recruitment of children with malaria in the Kela region of our study suggests roughly two-thirds less risk of severe malaria in young G6PD-deficient relative to G6PD-normal males.	[[289, 293], [316, 320]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5155	This level of protection from G6PD A− in hemizygous males 5 y old and younger is comparable to levels reported for hemoglobins C and S in certain West African populations [13,18,19]..	[[30, 34]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml

5157	For female children 5 y old and younger, the age range benefiting most from this effect, the OR of this trend was calculated to be 0.24 (95% CI 0.01–1.63), a value comparable to that for young hemizygous males.	[[141, 143], [93, 95]]	[]	['CI', 'OR']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml

5160	[6] observed a protective effect of G6PD A− against convulsions or coma in male children 6 mo to 4 y of age; numbers from the female cases were not considered statistically significant for conclusions.	[[36, 40]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5161	[5] concluded that G6PD A− is associated with a 46%–58% reduction in the risk of severe malaria for both hemizygous males and heterozygous females.	[[19, 23]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5162	Comparative assessments of G6PD deficiency in cases of severe versus uncomplicated malaria were not reported.	[[27, 31]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5163	We therefore focused on the natural selection of G6PD deficiency that arises from its ability to protect children against progression from uncomplicated to severe, life-threatening malaria..	[[49, 53]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5164	[5] provided data from The Gambia and Kenya on the prevalence of G6PD A− in children with severe or uncomplicated malaria.	[[65, 69]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5165	Using these data in stratified analysis, we calculate a pooled OR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.33–1.39; p = 0.32) for the protective effect of G6PD A− in the hemizygous males, whereas for the heterozygous females the pooled OR is 0.91 (95% CI 0.55–1.53; p = 0.71) (Table S1).

5167	Taken together, what do the different clinical studies of severe malaria in relation to the G6PD A− form of deficiency indicate for an overall estimate of relative protection? In the investigations producing the data from the Dogon, Malinké, Kenyan, and Gambian populations, the study designs, definitions of severe and uncomplicated malaria, and methodological details were similar in their significant aspects and are, therefore, informative when analyzed together.	[[92, 96]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5168	Pooled ORs from all four sets of data confirmed highly significant protection for hemizygous males (OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.77; p < 0.001), but not for heterozygous females (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.68–1.34; p = 0.87).

5169	This overall indication of protection is probably underestimated for hemizygous HbAA males who are 5 y old and younger, in light of our findings that G6PD deficiency reduces the risk of severe malaria more in this population..	[[150, 154]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5170	Results from this analysis showed statistically significant protection against cerebral malaria for hemizygous males (pooled OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.24–0.77; p = 0.002) but not for heterozygous females (pooled OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.59–1.39; p = 0.76).

5171	No significant OR for protection could be demonstrated for the recruitment groups with severe anemia (Table S2)..	[[15, 17]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5172	It is a balanced polymorphism, as the protection provided by this G6PD deficiency against severe malaria in hemizygous males (and perhaps homozygous females) is also associated with risks of life-threatening complications, e.g., neonatal jaundice and devastating hemolytic crises precipitated by viral infections or ingestion of medicinal or dietary oxidants [23].	[[66, 70]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5173	In hemizygous males and homozygous females, the risk of hemolysis and protection against severe malaria would both reflect the presence of uniformly G6PD-deficient populations of erythrocytes, whereas in heterozygous females the relative reduction of these risks and lack of protection are attributable to mosaic populations of G6PD-normal and G6PD-deficient erythrocytes circulating in the bloodstream.	[[149, 153], [328, 332], [344, 348]]	[]	['G6PD', 'G6PD', 'G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5174	Our evidence that the A− form of G6PD deficiency protects against severe malaria in its uniform (hemizygous, homozygous) but not mosaic (heterozygous) state appears more consistent than do previous proposals with currently hypothesized mechanisms of protection.	[[33, 37]]	[]	['G6PD']	[]	PMC1820604.nxml
5175	Enhanced phagocytosis of parasitized erythrocytes [11] or effects on the pathogenic consequences of parasitized erythrocytes in the microcirculation [24] would be expected to operate preferentially in individuals whose erythrocytes are uniformly deficient in G6PD..

5248	Some of the changes in NPI score are likely to be related to natural symptom course, or a Hawthorne effect, or regression to the mean, although there should be no imbalance in these factors between groups.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['NPI']	[]	PMC2276521.nxml
5249	The authors of the recent CATIE study [17], a large, pragmatic, 36-wk placebo-controlled trial of atypical neuroleptics in AD, concluded that the modest benefits were not sufficient to justify therapy in the presence of the increased risk of serious adverse events.

5250	Taking into consideration CATIE, the results of 6- to 12-wk placebo-controlled trials, and our own data, we would suggest that there is, however, a limited place for atypical neuroleptics in the maintenance treatment of severe neuropsychiatric manifestations (particularly aggression) in AD when there is tangible risk or severe distress, and the symptoms have been refractory to other treatment approaches..

5313	The discrete-time survival analysis showed that being very young at the start of the Lebanon wars (aged 0–10 y) increased the risk of developing a first onset of anxiety (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.08–6.12), mood (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.61–8.44), and impulse control (0–6 y) (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.08–4.02) disorders.

5317	This cumulative effect was also true for individual disorders (within the broader categories mentioned above), the highest ORs being those for intermittent explosive disorder (IED) (OR 30.38), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR 10.24), and dysthymia (OR 7.71) (Figure 1).

5320	This increased risk was shown for all anxiety disorders that had enough participants to be analyzed (separation anxiety disorder [SAD], PTSD, and GAD), for mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and dysthymia, but not for bipolar disorder), and for impulse control disorder (intermittent explosive disorder).	[[146, 149], [136, 140]]	[]	['GAD', 'PTSD']	[]	PMC2276523.nxml

5329	Recently, serological testing has been included in household health surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), giving estimates of HIV prevalence in the general adult population based on a standard methodology [8–10].	[[121, 124]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5330	This paper describes and tests two methods for this form of incidence estimation, with the intention that they can be applied in future to sequential prevalence data collected in household surveys, including the DHS..	[[212, 215]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5331	Furthermore, these earlier methods have not incorporated recent findings on HIV mortality, and their performance has not been assessed under evolving epidemiological conditions, such as changes in risk and increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)..	[[251, 254]]	[[227, 249]]	['ART']	['antiretroviral therapy']	PMC2288620.nxml
5332	In a real cohort, we can find an approximation to incidence by considering the change in the number of HIV-infected individuals and finding an approximation to the person-years spent at risk of infection (PYAR) in the cohort [24]..	[[205, 209]]	[]	['PYAR']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5333	Even in settings where HIV has reached high endemic levels, incidence rates are typically less than ∼4% [1,28], and in household health serosurveys such as DHS, the width of age groups and the interval between surveys is usually 5 y.	[[156, 159]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5334	If ART provision increases from 0% to 30% in the interval between two serosurveys, then the derived estimates of incidence are too high when mortality data from the pre-ART era are used (Figure 5).	[[3, 6], [169, 172]]	[]	['ART', 'ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5335	(ART coverage levels are likely to be much lower than this in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa [36].) This overestimate occurs because individuals are surviving longer with infection leading to increased HIV prevalence, but that prevalence trend is wrongly attributed to new infections by the estimation methods.	[[1, 4]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5336	The errors in later estimates of incidence, based on serosurveys taken while ART provision is maintained, become greater as more individuals start ART.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5337	The black line shows the estimates if ART is not provided.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5338	The serial measurements of cross-sectional prevalence that are required for these methods will soon be available from household surveys with HIV testing, such as DHS..	[[162, 165]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5339	The data we have used in the validation exercise were considered appropriate because they came from the same region and from a period during which ART was not widely available.	[[147, 150]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5340	If treatment with ART becomes more common, the mortality rate of infected people will change, and use of the mortality data provided here would lead to overestimates of incidence, particularly at older ages, for which the effect of ART will be greatest.	[[18, 21], [232, 235]]	[]	['ART', 'ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5341	If survival on ART is longer than we have assumed, then we would expect the errors to be greater.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5342	The errors in the estimates would increase over time if mortality data from the pre-ART era continued to be used, but new data from cohort studies incorporating the impact of ART will soon become available.	[[84, 87], [175, 178]]	[]	['ART', 'ART']	[]	PMC2288620.nxml
5343	Estimates of incidence among young people (under age 25 y) using existing mortality data from the pre-ART era are expected to remain reliable even when ART is common, as we have found that HIV mortality and ART eligibility are very low in this age range [44]..

5344	The relevance to coronary heart disease (CHD) of cytokines that govern inflammatory cascades, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), may be underestimated because such mediators are short acting and prone to fluctuations.

5345	We evaluated associations of long-term circulating IL-6 levels with CHD risk (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or fatal CHD) in two population-based cohorts, involving serial measurements to enable correction for within-person variability.	[[68, 71], [134, 137], [51, 55]]	[]	['CHD', 'CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5346	Measurements were made in samples obtained at baseline from 2,138 patients who had a first-ever nonfatal MI or died of CHD during follow-up, and from 4,267 controls in two cohorts comprising 24,230 participants.	[[119, 122], [105, 107]]	[]	['CHD', 'MI']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5347	The year-to-year variability of IL-6 values within individuals was relatively high (regression dilution ratios of 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28–0.53, over 4 y, and 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.48, over 12 y).

5349	After correction for within-person variability, the odds ratio for CHD was 2.14 (95% CI 1.45–3.15) with long-term average (“usual”) IL-6, similar to those for some established risk factors.	[[67, 70], [85, 87], [132, 136]]	[]	['CHD', 'CI', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5350	Increasing IL-6 levels were associated with progressively increasing CHD risk.	[[69, 72], [11, 15]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml

5352	Including the two current studies, the 17 available prospective studies gave a combined odds ratio of 1.61 (95% CI 1.42–1.83) per 2 SD increase in baseline IL-6 (corresponding to an odds ratio of 3.34 [95% CI 2.45–4.56] per 2 SD increase in usual [long-term average] IL-6 levels)..

5353	Long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk about as strongly as are some major established risk factors, but causality remains uncertain.	[[42, 45], [10, 14]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml

5358	Smoking, high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol (a type of fat), being overweight, and being physically inactive all increase the risk of developing CHD, as do some inherited factors.	[[164, 167]]	[]	['CHD']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5359	Treatments for CHD include lifestyle changes (for example, losing weight and exercising regularly) and medications that lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['CHD']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5360	In this study, the researchers have asked whether prolonged moderate increases in the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the bloodstream are associated with CHD risk.	[[155, 158], [110, 114]]	[[95, 108]]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	['interleukin-6']	PMC2288623.nxml
5361	Consequently, its relevance to CHD has been unclear in previous studies..	[[31, 34]]	[]	['CHD']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5362	The researchers measured baseline IL-6 blood levels in these participants and in 4,267 similar participants who had not had a CHD event.	[[126, 129], [34, 38]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5363	They also measured IL-6 levels in 558 healthy participants several years into the study to determine a “regression dilution ratio” for IL-6.	[[19, 23]]	[]	['IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5364	This ratio gives an idea of the year-to-year consistency of IL-6 levels.	[[60, 64]]	[]	['IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5365	When the researchers used this ratio to estimate the impact of prolonged increases in IL-6 levels on CHD, they found that increased long-term IL-6 levels more than doubled the risk for CHD in their study populations.

5369	Previous epidemiological studies of coronary heart disease (CHD) and inflammation have focused mainly on “downstream” acute phase reactants (e.g., fibrinogen [6] and C-reactive protein [7]) because they are comparatively stable within individuals over time.	[[60, 63]]	[[36, 58]]	['CHD']	['coronary heart disease']	PMC2288623.nxml
5370	By contrast, investigation of IL-6 in CHD has been relatively limited because of its shorter half-life (<2 h) and greater within-person variability.	[[38, 41], [30, 34]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml

5373	A recent nonquantitative review [22] reported on published data from five prospective studies of IL-6 and CHD, but it comprised only about one-third of the currently published evidence, and it mixed results of studies involving different vascular outcomes and of different study designs.

5374	Even a more comprehensive and consistent review of published reports would not, however, have been able to assess appropriately IL-6–CHD associations, because no individual prospective study to our knowledge has yet made allowances for the cytokine's within-person variability.

5375	Owing to fluctuations in IL-6 values over time, comparisons using only baseline values may yield biased estimates of the true association, which can be corrected, for the most part, by using data from paired measurements [23–27] (see Methods)..	[[25, 29]]	[]	['IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5376	We report new data on IL-6 levels from two population-based prospective cohorts, the Reykjavik Study and the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS), which together comprise 24,230 predominantly middle-aged individuals with an average of almost 20 years of follow-up per participant.

5388	IL-6 measurements were made in the Reykjavik Study and BRHS on available serum samples, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R & D Systems) in the Glasgow laboratory by the same technicians blinded to participants' disease status.	[[55, 59]]	[]	['BRHS']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5389	Measurements were made in pairs of samples from a randomly selected subset of baseline participants in each study, comprising 258 participants in the BRHS (samples collected at a median interval of about 4 y apart) and 300 participants in the Reykjavik Study (samples collected at a median interval of about 12 y apart).	[[150, 154]]	[]	['BRHS']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5390	Because the temperature of storage of the initial BRHS samples was −20 °C, whereas it was −70 °C at the resurvey, there was scope in this study for slight overestimation of within-person variability in IL-6 levels, encouraging comparison of its findings with those from the Reykjavik Study in which conditions at the two surveys were identical.

5391	In both the Reykjavik Study and BRHS, two or three control participants were randomly selected and frequency matched to incident CHD cases in 5-y age bands (and, in the Reykjavik Study, on calendar year of recruitment and sex; and in the all-male BRHS by town of residence), thereby obtaining the same joint frequency distributions of these factors among controls and cases.

5396	Analyses to investigate the shape of the IL-6–CHD association were conducted for groups defined by fifths of baseline IL-6 values in controls, with corresponding 95% CIs estimated from floating variances that reflect the amount of information underlying each group (including the reference group) [31–33].

5397	Data from paired measurements in the Reykjavik Study, which coincided with approximately the midpoint of this study's follow-up duration, were used to quantify and to correct for within-person variability in IL-6 and other risk factors, which are likely to be measured with error owing to both within-person biological variability and laboratory variability.

5401	Correction for multivariate within-person variability in both IL-6 and error-prone confounders was achieved using a multivariable linear regression model [27] from which conditional expectations of usual levels of IL-6 and the error-prone confounders were predicted and then substituted in place of the baseline levels in the logistic model to obtain the corrected odds ratios.

5407	Three studies of IL-6 (comprising approximately 450 CHD cases or 7% of the total) [35–37] were excluded because they reported on composite cardiovascular outcomes rather than for MI or fatal CHD separately.

5409	Heterogeneity was quantified by the I2 statistic [38,39], and subsidiary subgroup analyses were conducted using metaregression [40] to investigate several study-level characteristics potentially explaining heterogeneity, including population sampling methods, duration of follow-up, source and type of IL-6 assay, blood storage temperature, geographical region, number of CHD cases, sex, degree of adjustment of other cardiovascular risk factors, and whether individuals with CHD at baseline were excluded from analysis.

5423	Similar point estimates for the regression dilution ratios of loge IL-6 levels over 4- and 12-y intervals may reflect that much of the variability in this marker is related to shorter-term rather than longer-term factors, although CIs around these estimates were relatively wide.

5424	As there were no signification associations between within-person differences in loge IL-6 levels and time intervals between measurements (p = 0.53), it is unlikely that increasing age of participants explains the generally higher mean loge IL-6 levels at resurvey.

[[35, 39], [210, 214]]	[]	['IL-6', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5444	By showing that pathways mediated by long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk about as strongly as are some major established risk factors, the current data reinforce interest in the connection between inflammatory pathways and cardiovascular diseases.	[[79, 82], [47, 51]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5445	Serious underestimation is likely without such correction because, as demonstrated in the current study, the variability in IL-6 levels is substantially higher than for downstream inflammatory markers and several established CHD risk factors.	[[225, 228], [124, 128]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml
5446	Hence, given the central role of IL-6 levels in inflammatory pathways and its continuous association with CHD risk, it warrants further investigation as a plausible potential therapeutic target.	[[106, 109], [33, 37]]	[]	['CHD', 'IL-6']	[]	PMC2288623.nxml

5453	Paired IL-6 (and other) measurements enabled approximate correction for within-person variability in a way that implies that long-term average IL-6 values are relevant to CHD risk, consistent with prevailing hypotheses of sustained low-grade inflammation, but it is not clear why mean loge IL-6 levels were generally higher at resurvey examinations..

5454	In comparison with a previous nonquantitative review [22], the current meta-analysis involved almost five times as many incident CHD cases from population-based prospective studies (thereby enhancing statistical power), strictly defined CHD as MI or fatal CHD (thereby enhancing accuracy of disease classification), excluded (where possible) people with prevalent cardiovascular disease (thereby limiting potential biases), and explored in detail potential sources of heterogeneity (thereby probing possible causes of study diversity).

5487	Cellular uptake of MTX is mediated by the protein reduced folate carrier [8], whereas its efflux is mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC), subfamily C 1 (ABCC1) and ABCC4 [9–11].	[[134, 137], [19, 22]]	[]	['ABC', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5488	Within leukemic cells, MTX is metabolized into poly(γ-glutamate) forms (MTXPGs) by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent reaction catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthetase [13].	[[23, 26], [72, 77]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTXPG']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5489	Compared to their monoglutamate form, MTXPGs are retained longer in cells because they are not readily effluxed by ABC transporters [14,15].	[[115, 118], [38, 43]]	[]	['ABC', 'MTXPG']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml

5566	Additionally, we predicted the WBCDay3 after initial MTX treatment based on the known WBCPRE in these 18 newly enrolled patients.	[[53, 56], [31, 38], [86, 92]]	[]	['MTX', 'WBCDay3', 'WBCPRE']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5567	For that, we used either the WBCΔDay3 linear regression function or the median WBC%drop developed in the original test cohort of 293 patients.	[[79, 87], [29, 37]]	[]	['WBC%drop', 'WBCΔDay3']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml

5569	The observed WBCDay3 values are significantly closer to the predicted values using WBCΔDay3 (Figure 6B) than those based on WBC%drop (Figure 6C; p = 0.0025, paired t-test), thereby further indicating that WBCΔDay3 is a more accurate measure of in vivo MTX response than WBC%drop..

5570	The drug resistance and gene expression profiles of leukemia cells have also been used to identify genes related to the sensitivity of ALL cells to several antileukemic agents and to forecast differences in treatment response [5,20,21].	[[135, 138]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5571	These findings have also revealed novel targets for the discovery of new agents to reverse drug resistance, such as our prior discovery of MCL1 overexpression in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL [5], and the subsequent discovery that rapamycin can down-regulate MCL1 expression and increase sensitivity of leukemia cells to dexamethasone [37,40].	[[187, 190]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5572	However, prior to the current study, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of genes related to the antileukemic effects of MTX in primary leukemia cells..	[[129, 132]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5573	We therefore evaluated MTX response in vivo after initial therapy, because this is the only possible time to assess the antileukemic effects of MTX as a single agent in patients and because there are no reliable in vitro methods.	[[23, 26], [144, 147]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5574	Thus, our study focused on treatment-naive ALL, and assessed de novo resistance.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5575	This revealed that WBCΔDay3 is a superior measure of in vivo MTX response when compared to the percentage drop in leukemia cells (i.e., WBC%drop), and that WBCΔDay3 was predictive of long-term DFS.

5576	Furthermore, the difference in survival cannot simply be explained by differences in MTX systemic exposure (Figure S6)..	[[85, 88]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5577	To better understand the biological basis underlying MTX response in ALL cells, we used an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify genes whose expression in primary leukemia cells in vivo was significantly related to WBCΔDay3.	[[69, 72], [53, 56]]	[]	['ALL', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5578	This process revealed 48 genes and two cDNA clones that are highly related to the in vivo MTX response (WBCΔDay3), even after adjusting for MTXPG accumulation (n = 230) (Table S3).	[[90, 93], [140, 145], [104, 112]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTXPG', 'WBCΔDay3']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5579	Among those genes significantly associated with MTX response were genes involved in nucleotide metabolism (TYMS and CTPS), cell proliferation and apoptosis (BCL3, CDC20, CENPF, and FAIM3), and DNA replication or repair (POLD3, RPA3, RNASEH2A, RPM1, and H2AFX).	[[48, 51]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5580	The antileukemic effects of MTX involve inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and the current findings indicate that interindividual differences in nucleotide synthesis influence the in vivo antileukemic effects of MTX.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5581	This finding was confirmed by a global test analysis that identified the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway as one of the most discriminating biological pathways related to MTX response.	[[170, 173]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5582	Our analysis also showed that low expression of DHFR, TYMS, and CTPS was significantly correlated with poor in vivo MTX response [6,41,42].	[[116, 119]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5583	It has been shown that DHFR, TYMS, and CTPS expression is associated with critical biological processes such as DNA synthesis and cell proliferation [43,44], a finding consistent with low expression of these genes reflecting a decrease in the number of ALL cells in S-phase.	[[253, 256]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5584	As MTX selectively affects cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle [7,44,45], it is likely that low expression of these genes explains the observed association with MTX response.	[[3, 6], [164, 167]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5585	To support this hypothesis, we showed that the percentage of leukemia cells in the S-phase was strongly correlated with DHFR, TYMS, and CTPS expression and with the MTX in vivo response (Figure S5, Table 2).	[[165, 168]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5586	This finding does not preclude the possibility that genetically determined high TYMS expression in ALL cells is associated with a worse prognosis in ALL, as we have previously reported [46].	[[99, 102], [149, 152]]	[]	['ALL', 'ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5587	After remission is achieved, higher TYMS expression due to the promoter polymorphism would connote a worse prognosis due to higher levels of the MTX target, thymidylate synthase, independent of cellular proliferation rates..	[[145, 148]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5588	Our current data showed that low cell proliferation levels, in addition to our measure of in vivo MTX response, is an important ALL cell characteristic related to worse outcome.	[[128, 131], [98, 101]]	[]	['ALL', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5589	In the current study, the gene expression profile predicting MTX response was not associated with overall disease outcome after adjusting for other known prognostic variables in the entire study population (p = 0.08), but was significantly related to DFS within high-risk patients (p = 0.014).	[[251, 254], [61, 64]]	[]	['DFS', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5590	Leukemia cells of patients with high-risk ALL may intrinsically have a higher potential for poor MTX response (e.g., because of oncogenic gene fusions), in contrast to lower-risk patients whose ALL cells may acquire resistance mechanisms during the 2–3 y of therapy.	[[42, 45], [194, 197], [97, 100]]	[]	['ALL', 'ALL', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5591	Further, it is possible that patients with high-risk leukemia may be more prone to acquire resistance during therapy for various reasons (e.g., greater genetic instability in their ALL cells)..	[[181, 184]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5592	Interestingly, other known folate metabolism genes were not among the top genes, suggesting that expression of the known folate metabolism genes in pretreatment ALL cells is less important in causing de novo MTX resistance than previously thought.	[[161, 164], [208, 211]]	[]	['ALL', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5593	It may well be that these folate pathway genes are important for the acquired drug resistance that emerges during MTX treatment.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5594	It is also plausible that expression or function of these proteins is not reflected by the level of their mRNA expression in ALL cells.	[[125, 128]]	[]	['ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5595	Defining the genomic determinants of ALL resistance to individual antileukemic agents is essential if the pharmacogenomics of drug resistance are to be elucidated, because the current and prior studies have shown that genes discriminating drug resistance in ALL are drug specific [5,48].	[[37, 40], [258, 261]]	[]	['ALL', 'ALL']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5596	To assess whether the genes we identified as related to de novo MTX resistance reflect a global resistance phenotype versus a MTX-specific effect, we compared the previously reported gene expression profiles for ALL resistance to PVAD (prednisone, vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin), with the top 50 genes discriminating MTX response in the current study.	[[212, 215], [64, 67], [126, 129], [331, 334]]	[]	['ALL', 'MTX', 'MTX', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5597	This comparison revealed no overlap in the genes related to MTX resistance and the 124 genes related to prednisone, vincristine, asparaginase or daunorubicin PVAD resistance [5].	[[60, 63]]	[]	['MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5598	This result indicates that genes identified in the current study are not a marker of general drug resistance or a global predictor of survival, rather they are specific to MTX (or perhaps other antifolates, but not all ALL chemotherapy).	[[219, 222], [172, 175]]	[]	['ALL', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5599	Furthermore, we applied our MTX gene expression profile to the publicly available German/Dutch dataset [5], and documented that the MTX gene expression profile is not related to prednisolone sensitivity in this independent patient cohort (unpublished data)..	[[28, 31], [132, 135]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml
5600	Among the 50 genes that were expressed at a significantly different level in leukemia cells of MTX good responders versus poor responders, 29 were overexpressed in the MTX poor- responders.	[[95, 98], [168, 171]]	[]	['MTX', 'MTX']	[]	PMC2292747.nxml

5632	Finally, the researchers attached this plectin-1–targeted peptide (PTP) to a nanoparticles that was both magnetic and fluorescent (PTP-NP) and used special microscopy (which detects the fluorescent part of this very small particle) and MRI (which detects its magnetic portion) to show that this potential imaging probe was found in areas of PDAC (but not in normal pancreatic tissue) in the mouse model of human PDAC..

5633	These findings identify PTP as a peptide that can distinguish normal pancreatic cells from pancreatic cancer cells.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['PTP']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5634	The discovery that plectin-1 (a cytoskeletal component) is abnormally expressed on the cell surface of PDACs provides new information about the development of pancreatic cancer that could eventually lead to new ways to treat this disease.	[[103, 107]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5635	These findings also show that PTP can be used to generate a nanoparticle-based imaging agent that can detect PDAC within a normal pancreas.	[[109, 113], [30, 33]]	[]	['PDAC', 'PTP']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5636	Nevertheless, they suggest that PTP-NPs might allow the noninvasive detection of early tumors in people at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer, an advance that could extend their lives by identifying tumors earlier, when they can be removed surgically..	[[32, 35], [32, 38]]	[]	['PTP', 'PTP-NP']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5637	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and shows a rapid clinical course, with a median survival of 6 mo and a 5-y survival rate of only 3% [1].	[[34, 38]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5638	Indeed, the detection of PDAC or high-grade precursors in high-risk patient groups (e.g., hereditary cancer syndromes, chronic pancreatitis, and new-onset diabetes) represents a critical unmet need in the cancer diagnostic portfolio [3,4].	[[25, 29]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5639	Additionally, tools to distinguish PDAC from benign cystic lesions frequently detected incidentally on cross-sectional imaging would be clinically useful by diminishing the need for invasive procedures.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5640	Currently, serum CA-19–9 is the only clinically used biomarker; however, it lacks the sensitivity needed to detect early-stage PDAC [5].	[[127, 131]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5641	In addition, cross-sectional abdominal imaging has proven to be unreliable to detect early-stage PDAC in high-risk patients [6].	[[97, 101]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5642	Therefore, considerable ongoing efforts aimed at identifying new PDAC detection biomarkers are currently being pursued using a variety of approaches including serum proteomics, expression profiling of tumor tissue, genetic analysis of pancreatic fluid, and methods using combinatorial chemistry [5,7–10]..	[[65, 69]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5643	There is a substantial challenge in studying the early molecular changes in PDAC because of the typical presentation of PDAC at advanced stage and the corresponding lack of suitable tissue specimens.	[[76, 80], [120, 124]]	[]	['PDAC', 'PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5644	Therefore, we elected to exploit a series of related genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC that harbor the signature gene mutations of the human disease, including Kras activation and deletion of the p53 or Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressors [11,12].	[[92, 96]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5645	The tumors in these models exhibit the characteristic multistage histopathological progression (from precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasis [PanINs] [13] to metastatic cancer) that defines PDAC in humans, providing tractable model systems for both biological and preclinical studies [11].	[[197, 201]]	[]	['PDAC']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml
5646	Here, we describe the use of peptide phage display and early passage PDAC cell lines isolated from the above mouse models to identify peptides that distinguish both human and murine PDAC cells from normal pancreatic ductal cells in vitro.

5686	We further validated the specificity of clone 27 by incubating FITC-27 or FITC-unrelated phage clone (negative control) with mouse PDAC cells, with five human PDAC cell lines, and with normal human ductal cells and then analyzing uptake via fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS).

5688	Phage clone 27 labeled with fluorochrome was used as a probe to test binding to frozen sections of normal pancreas, pancreata containing focal PanINs, and pancreata with PDAC.	[[143, 149]]	[]	['PanINs']	[]	PMC2292750.nxml

5751	Before birth, chorionic gonadotropin (CG; a hormone made by the placenta) stimulates Leydig cell development and testosterone production; after birth, luteinizing hormone (LH), which is made by the pituitary gland, stimulates testosterone production.

5759	Both introns and exons are transcribed into messenger RNA [mRNA] and the exons are then “spliced” together to make the mature mRNA, which is translated into protein.) The researchers identify several differently spliced LHCGR mRNA transcripts that contain exon 6A—a terminal exon 6A mRNA that contains exons 1–6 and exon 6A, and two internal exon 6A mRNAs that also contain exons 7–11.	[[220, 225]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml

[[141, 146], [197, 202]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml

5841	These data suggest that the mutation in exon 6A specifically alters the splicing pattern of the LHCGR gene, with a large increase of transcripts not contributing to the generation of the mature, full-length receptor protein, and it thereby prevents the physiological cAMP response to hCG stimulation..

5848	We suggest that the genomic organization of the LHCGR gene in the primates be revised to include exon 6A, and hypothesize that the mRNA transcript without exon 6A encoding for the known LHCGR protein represents a splicing variant of the revised LHCGR gene (Figure S2) [13].

5849	It is tempting to speculate that the appearance of exon 6A in the primate LHCGR gene is connected with the evolutionary appearance of CG in primates and its function during sexual differentiation and in pregnancy recognition and maintenance [9,10]..	[[134, 136], [74, 79]]	[]	['CG', 'LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5850	The strength of the signal obtained with the exon 6A probe, which is at least comparable with the signal intensities of the full-length LHCGR mRNA, corroborates the finding obtained from the relative quantification studies (Figure 4), while the comet-like signal indicates a spectrum of transcripts of various lengths.	[[136, 141]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5851	If, as postulated, exon 6A-containg transcripts undergo NMD this pattern could derive from partially degraded transcripts from the LHCGR exon 6A internal variants and from the terminal exon 6 variant (calculated size approximately 650 bp).	[[131, 136], [56, 59]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5852	A comparison with transcript patterns from other genes/exons undergoing NMD is not possible, since to our knowledge no other data on Northern blot hybridization of such transcripts have yet been performed..	[[72, 75]]	[]	['NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5853	However, this is the first time to our knowledge that a human disease has been strongly associated with mutations in a cryptic exon that resembles a target for NMD and does not contribute to the final/mature protein structure [14].	[[160, 163]]	[]	['NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5854	We hypothesize that the mutations in exon 6A described in this paper result in modifications of the relative amounts of each LHCGR transcript in the Leydig cells, with highly increased accumulation of variants including exon 6A.	[[125, 130]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5855	This dramatic change overwhelms the NMD machinery and/or alters the pattern of protein translation and transportation, resulting in an insufficient amount of full-length, mature LHCGR protein at the cell surface.	[[178, 183], [36, 39]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5856	This assumption is corroborated by the in vitro functional data demonstrating the incapability of the A557C construct to produce enough functional receptor protein and by the fact that immunohistological staining for the LHCGR in testis sections of the A557C patient was negative, whereas Leydig cells from sections of intact testes and from LCH patients displaying a “classical” inactivating mutation, hindering proper membrane trafficking or signal transduction of the LHCGR, stained positive (Figure S4) [15,16]..

5858	We propose that a complex network, including the novel transcripts described here and involving NMD, regulates LHCGR expression at both the transcriptional and translational level (Figure 8).	[[111, 116], [96, 99]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5859	The spectrum of LHCGR transcripts includes forms with and without exon 6A, but only the LHCGR mRNA transcript lacking exon 6A will lead to a functional protein [17].	[[16, 21], [88, 93]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5860	The levels of such a “normal” transcript and its translation probably depend on the correct function of two distinct regulatory avenues processing the LHCGR mRNA including exon 6A.	[[151, 156]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5861	On one side the variant in which exon 6A acts as terminal exon may give rise to a protein potentially capable of hormone binding and/or of interaction with the mature LHCGR protein, thereby acting as modifier of hormone action.	[[167, 172]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5862	On the other side the correct processing of the LHCGR transcripts without exon 6A may depend on the elimination by NMD of the variants including the internal exon 6A.	[[48, 53], [115, 118]]	[]	['LHCGR', 'NMD']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5863	This complex pattern of LHCGR transcripts form a network which, considering the strong physiological constraints of LH/CG action, must be tightly regulated.	[[119, 121], [24, 29]]	[]	['CG', 'LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml
5864	We postulate that the strict regulation of this network is crucial for establishing the correct ratio between the transcripts, which in turn allows proper LHCGR functioning [18].	[[155, 160]]	[]	['LHCGR']	[]	PMC2323302.nxml

5866	Should exon 6A be mutated, the NMD machinery might be unable to process the transcripts efficiently and, if a substantial part of them is translated, the functional LHCGR protein will compete with the truncated LHCGR protein derived from terminal and internal exon 6A variants [19,20].

5898	The spread of male life expectancy across US counties, as measured by SD, rose slowly in the 1960s, then declined steeply until 1983 (1.9 y), when it began to rise again to 2.3 in 1999; the rate of increase declined in the 1990s (Figure 1).	[[70, 72]]	[]	['SD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5899	For women, cross-county life expectancy SD declined between 1961 and 1983 (from 2.0 y to 1.4 y), but rose steadily to 1.7 y in 1999.	[[40, 42]]	[]	['SD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5900	Cross-county life expectancy SD was always larger for men than for women..	[[29, 31]]	[]	['SD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5901	The broad improvement of life expectancy observed during this period was primarily caused by major reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality for both sexes, compensating and surpassing the rise in cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	[[253, 257]]	[[214, 251]]	['COPD']	['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease']	PMC2323303.nxml
5902	The decline in female life expectancy after 1983 was caused by a rise in mortality from lung cancer, COPD, diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases in the older ages (Figure 4; detailed numerical results available in Dataset S1).	[[101, 105]]	[]	['COPD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5903	Female mortality from lung cancer, COPD, and even diabetes had also risen in 1961–1983, but this rise was surpassed by the decline in cardiovascular disease mortality.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['COPD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5904	Mortality from diabetes, cancers, and COPD in the older ages also worsened in men but these continued to be countered by relatively large reductions in male cardiovascular mortality..	[[38, 42]]	[]	['COPD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5905	If cross-county migration had been the only factor affecting any county's mortality, the SD of life expectancy in US counties would have declined from 1.89 y in 1993 to 1.71 in 1999 if emigrants had the same life expectancy as those who stayed in the county or origin; in practice it increased to 1.99 (Table 3).	[[89, 91]]	[]	['SD']	[]	PMC2323303.nxml
5906	The SD in 1999 would have been 1.71 if emigrants had a life expectancy that was 1 y higher than those who stayed in the country of origin, and 1.78 if only those migrating to counties of higher life expectancy had a life expectancy 1 y higher than those who stayed in the country of origin or migrated to counties of lower life expectancy.

5907	In fact, only in extremely polarized migration scenarios—when migrants to counties with higher life expectancy have a 2.3-y advantage over those who stay in the county of origin—does the net effect of migration become an increase, rather than a decrease, in cross-county life expectancy SD (for comparison, the change in national life expectancy in the United States was 2.3 y between 1982 and 1999).

5910	To examine if the observed cross-county mortality distribution in Figure 1 is caused by a clustering of black population, we estimated the SD of county life expectancies separately for white and black populations of US counties in 1983–1999 (the race-specific analysis included all counties for whites and those counties with sufficient population and deaths to allow life expectancy calculation for blacks).

5925	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious disease in which the lungs become progressively scarred or thickened for unknown reasons.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
5926	In IPF, the alveoli and the space around them (the “interstitial” area) gradually become scarred and thickened, which stops oxygen's movement into the bloodstream.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml

5932	In this study, the researchers look for peripheral blood biomarkers in IPF by using a “multiplex analysis” system to measure the level of several proteins in patient blood samples simultaneously..	[[71, 74]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
5933	The researchers measured the levels of 49 plasma proteins (plasma is the fluid part of blood) in 74 patients with IPF and 53 healthy people (controls) and used a technique called “recursive partitioning” to define a five-protein signature that distinguished patients from unaffected study participants (controls).	[[114, 117]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
5934	Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and MMP1—the two plasma proteins whose levels were most increased in patients with IPF compared to controls—were key components of this signature.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
5935	Concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 were higher in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (fluid obtained by washing out the lungs with saline) and in lung tissue samples from patients with IPF than in similar samples taken from healthy individuals.	[[178, 181]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
5936	Plasma concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 were significantly higher in patients with IPF than in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an interstitial lung disease that mimics IPF, but not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis, two other lung diseases.

5937	In an independent validation group, patients with IPF and familial pulmonary fibrosis had increased plasma concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 that correlated with the severity of their disease.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml

5939	However, additional work is probably needed to confirm that increased plasma concentrations MMP7 and MMP1 are specific for IPF, since it may be that these markers will not distinguish IPF from other interstitial lung diseases..	[[123, 126], [184, 187]]	[]	['IPF', 'IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml

6021	MMP7 and MMP1, two matrix metalloproteases previously implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF [31], are significantly increased in plasma, serum, BAL fluid, and lung tissue of IPF patients, suggesting that increased MMP7 and MMP1 levels in the peripheral blood are indicative of the pathologic changes that characterize the IPF alveolar microenvironment.

6023	Taken together our findings support the use of MMP1 and MMP7 as IPF biomarkers and suggest that their role in diagnosis, early detection, and monitoring of disease progression should be further investigated..	[[64, 67]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6024	Multiple MMPs are among the 12 proteins significantly increased in the blood of IPF patients.	[[80, 83], [9, 12]]	[]	['IPF', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6025	The roles of MMPs have been intensively studied and debated in IPF [35].	[[63, 66], [13, 16]]	[]	['IPF', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6026	While multiple and often contrasting roles have been proposed for MMPs in regulating abnormal epithelial response to injury, fibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix accumulation, and aberrant tissue remodeling, the consensus is that this family of matrix degrading enzymes is involved in disease pathogenesis [31,36–40].	[[66, 69]]	[]	['MMP']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6027	The two top-ranked proteins in this study are MMPs known to be significantly overexpressed in the activated alveolar epithelium in IPF lungs.	[[131, 134], [46, 49]]	[]	['IPF', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6028	MMP1, a matrix metalloprotease that primarily degrades fibrillar collagen, is rarely expressed under normal conditions, but is highly overexpressed in reactive alveolar epithelial cells in IPF lungs [39].	[[189, 192]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6029	MMP7, a matrix metalloprotease with multiple local inflammatory regulatory roles [41,42], is also highly upregulated in alveolar epithelial cells in IPF [39,43].	[[149, 152]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6030	Taken in the above context, our results strongly suggest that activated epithelial cells in IPF lungs are the likely source of elevated peripheral blood concentrations of MMP1 and MMP7, thus supporting their use as biomarkers for disease detection and progression..	[[92, 95]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6031	Our data show that neither patients with COPD, a chronic progressive lung disease, nor patients with sarcoidosis, a chronic granulomatous ILD, express significantly increased peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 or MMP1.	[[41, 45], [138, 141]]	[]	['COPD', 'ILD']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6032	Further, elevated peripheral blood MMP1 concentrations, in the presence of elevated MMP7 concentrations, distinguish IPF from HP.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6033	A similar trend in gene expression of MMP7 and MMP1 is found in the lungs of patients with IPF and HP, further supporting the notion that the changes in peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 are reflective of the lung gene environment and constitute a disease-specific signal.	[[99, 101], [91, 94]]	[]	['HP', 'IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6034	This finding may be very important clinically, because subacute HP is frequently misdiagnosed as idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and in its chronic advanced form HP can be undistinguishable from IPF [32–34].	[[64, 66], [184, 186], [217, 220], [144, 148]]	[[108, 142]]	['HP', 'HP', 'IPF', 'NSIP']	['nonspecific interstitial pneumonia']	PMC2346504.nxml
6035	In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that histopathologic and HRCT abnormalities observed in chronic HP often overlap with those of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), representing an important challenge to the differential diagnosis of these conditions [33,34,44].	[[106, 108], [67, 71]]	[]	['HP', 'HRCT']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6036	Thus, the elevated peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 observed in IPF are not due to a systemic stress response to a chronic lung disease and distinguish COPD, sarcoidosis, and HP from IPF.	[[168, 172], [191, 193], [80, 83]]	[]	['COPD', 'HP', 'IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6037	While we do not advocate at this stage relying solely on peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 in distinguishing IPF from HP, sarcoidosis, or the less difficult differential diagnosis of COPD, it seems likely that knowing these concentrations will impact clinical decision-making..	[[198, 202], [133, 135], [124, 127]]	[]	['COPD', 'HP', 'IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6038	We did not compare IPF to other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias such as NSIP.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6039	There is nothing in our data to suggest that we can distinguish IPF from these diseases using MMP7 and MMP1 peripheral blood concentrations.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['IPF']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6040	In fact the finding of elevated MMP7 in patients with subclinical ILD may be indicative that this increase may be present in other idiopathic ILDs.	[[66, 69], [142, 145]]	[]	['ILD', 'ILD']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6041	Furthermore, gene expression patterns were found to be extremely similar in IPF and NSIP [30,45], and BAL MMP7 levels were also recently found to be similar in patients with IPF and NSIP [46].

6042	The major limitation in these studies was the small number of cases with NSIP because of the substantial rarity of isolated NSIP.	[[73, 77]]	[]	['NSIP']	[]	PMC2346504.nxml
6043	Therefore our results should encourage the establishment of multicenter collections of peripheral blood samples of patients with ILD with sufficient power to determine whether NSIP and IPF differ in their peripheral blood protein expression..

6044	In comparison to other studies, major attributes of our analysis include the relatively large size of our derivation cohort and the large number of proteins assayed in this cohort of patients with IPF, the comparison of peripheral blood biomarker levels with their gene expression levels in the lungs and BAL, the comparison with multiple relatively large control populations with other chronic lung diseases to establish specificity of our findings, and the verification of our initial results in an independent validation cohort.

6104	The bulk response of HIV-1–specific CD8+ T cells directed against the eight studied epitopes in the treatment group decreased (average ± SD: 2.3% ± 3.2% to 0.89% ± 1.0%, p = 0.21) following initiation of HAART, as described previously [31–34], but this decrease in HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies was not statistically significant.

6105	In contrast, the bulk antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses did not change in the untreated group during the study period (average ± SD: 0.82% ± 1.34% to 0.72% ± 0.73%)..	[[134, 136]]	[]	['SD']	[]	PMC2365971.nxml

6107	In contrast to this overall reduction in the functional profile of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells during untreated viremic infection, the functional profile of HIV-1–specific CD8+ T cells in individuals who were treated with HAART was largely maintained or even expanded, as shown in Figure 1C for patient Ac-85.

6112	The variant peptide was recognized with much lower functional avidity at all concentrations than was the A3-RK9 WT peptide..	[[112, 114]]	[]	['WT']	[]	PMC2365971.nxml
6113	In striking contrast, CD8+ T cells directed against the 15 HIV-1 epitopes that showed amino acid substitutions from the first to the second time point maintained a more diverse functional profile over time and the monofunctionality remained stable or slightly decreased for responses directed against escaped epitopes from 61% (95% CI 47%–75%) to 56% (42%–70%) (SD of the effect size 0.18).	[[332, 334], [362, 364]]	[]	['CI', 'SD']	[]	PMC2365971.nxml
6114	The increase in epitope-specific CD8+ T cell functionality (defined as the percent increase in epitope-specific CD8+ T cells with more than one function) was furthermore significantly correlated (R = 0.5, p = 0.025) to changes in functional avidity (defined as the change in the IC50 for epitopes that developed sequence variations, see Figure S2, and set to 0 for those epitopes that remained conserved during the study period).

6116	While the MFI (± standard deviation [SD]) of PD-1 on epitope-specific tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells increased for the seven conserved epitopes over time (210 ± 156 to 309 ± 334; see Figure S3), PD-1 expression significantly decreased on the five epitope-specific CD8+ T cells that developed a sequence variation in the targeted epitope (399 ± 123 to 248 ± 103, p = 0.006 paired t-test) (Figure 5), but was still higher than the PD-1 negative control.

6119	To more precisely investigate the impact of antigen on the functionality of CD8+ T cells, we longitudinally studied epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses directed against conserved and escaping CTL epitopes in the same study participant.	[[195, 198]]	[]	['CTL']	[]	PMC2365971.nxml
6120	This approach allowed us to directly compare, within the same study participant, epitope-specific CD8+ T cell populations that were continuously driven by antigen (conserved CTL epitopes) to those, where the specific antigen/epitope evaded by sequence variation (escaped CTL epitopes).	[[174, 177], [271, 274]]	[]	['CTL', 'CTL']	[]	PMC2365971.nxml
6121	The biphasic pattern of the decrease of PD-1 expression (Figure 5) suggests that PD-1-positive epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses that are highly exhausted either become apoptotic and die, while PD-1low epitope-specific CD8+ T cell subsets expand following CTL escape, or that PD-1high cells are partially down-regulating PD-1 expression on the cell surface.

6125	Testing pregnant women for HIV at the time of labor and delivery is the last opportunity for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) measures, particularly in settings where women do not receive adequate antenatal care.	[[141, 146]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6126	HIV-positive women were administered PMTCT interventions.	[[37, 42]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6127	Thus, 11 HIV-positive women received PMTCT interventions on account of round-the-clock rapid HIV testing and counseling in the labor room.	[[37, 42]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6128	In addition, 11 (73%) of a total of 15 HIV-positive women received PMTCT interventions because of round-the-clock rapid testing in the labor ward.	[[67, 72]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6129	These findings are relevant for PMTCT programs in developing countries..	[[32, 37]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6130	In developing countries, the prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) is much less effective, in part because pregnant women often do not know their HIV status.	[[49, 54]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6131	All the women were given a 15-minute counseling session about how HIV is transmitted, the importance of HIV testing, and information on PMTCT before their child was born (prepartum counseling), and a longer postpartum counseling session.	[[136, 141]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6132	Finally, the rapid HIV tests missed only one HIV-positive woman (no false-positive results were given), and the time from enrolling a woman into the study through referring her for PMTCT intervention where necessary averaged 40–60 minutes..	[[181, 186]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml

6153	Additionally, prophylaxis, and continuity of care was done at the Internal Medicine department of the MGIMS hospital.	[[102, 107]]	[]	['MGIMS']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6154	HIV infected infants were referred to the Pediatrics department of the MGIMS hospital for care and follow up..	[[71, 76]]	[]	['MGIMS']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6155	Based on previous Indian studies and clinical experience at the study site, we a priori anticipated an overall HIV prevalence of 1.5% among women admitted to the labor ward at the MGIMS hospital.	[[180, 185]]	[]	['MGIMS']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6156	Outcomes of the study included HIV seroprevalence, diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests, client preference for rapid tests, proportion of women whose HIV status was documented because of labor ward testing, proportion of new HIV cases that were picked up because of labor ward testing, and proportion of HIV-positive women who received PMTCT interventions because of labor ward testing.	[[334, 339]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6157	HIV seroprevalence was calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).	[[71, 73]]	[[49, 68]]	['CI']	['confidence interval']	PMC2365974.nxml
6158	Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (false-positive rate), with 95% CI estimates.	[[121, 123]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6159	Thus, the overall HIV seroprevalence rate during the study period was 1.23% (95% CI 0.61%–1.8%).	[[81, 83]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6160	Overall, of the 1,222 women who underwent testing in the labor ward, 1,003 (82%; 95% CI 79.8%–84.2%) had never been HIV tested, or had been tested but were unaware of their HIV status (Figure 1).	[[85, 87]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6161	Thus, 11 of 15 HIV infected (73.3%; 95% CI: 47.5%–90.9%) women were newly diagnosed at point-of-care, resulting in substantially higher case detection of HIV positives due to the round-the-clock testing program..	[[40, 42]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6162	Of the 15 HIV-positive women, 14 (93.3%; 95% CI 71.3%–99.7%) received PMTCT interventions, both in the intrapartum and postpartum period.	[[45, 47], [70, 75]]	[]	['CI', 'PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6163	This participant and the infant did not receive intrapartum interventions, but were administered ART postpartum, within 24 h of receiving the positive test results..	[[97, 100]]	[]	['ART']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6164	In sum, the total time from eligibility assessment of the study participant to referral for PMTCT intervention averaged 40–60 min..	[[92, 97]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6165	The sensitivity of both tests was 93.3% (95% CI 71.3–99.7%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 99.75–100%).	[[45, 47], [90, 92]]	[]	['CI', 'CI']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6166	In addition, 11 of a total of 15 HIV-positive women received PMTCT interventions because they underwent rapid testing in the labor ward.	[[61, 66]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6167	Individual-level factors include poverty and difficulty in accessing health care, reluctance of rural women to seek hospital care as opposed to midwife-based home care, stigma, fear of obtaining a positive test result coupled with the fear of intimate partner violence and ostracism by the partner's family, and lack of awareness about the effectiveness of PMTCT interventions [18].	[[357, 362]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6168	Regional- and national-level factors are: (1) lack of infrastructure (including availability of round-the-clock laboratory technicians); (2) irregular and insufficient supply of HIV rapid test kits; (3) cumbersome and time-consuming blood-based rapid tests; (4) lack of 24-h round-the-clock counseling services; and (5) women presenting late in labor (often within obstetric complications), which makes it difficult for obstetricians to arrange for urgent PMTCT interventions [4,10].	[[456, 461]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6169	In our study, by offering round-the-clock rapid testing and two-stage counseling, we were able to deliver PMTCT interventions to women who presented late in labor with no prior history of HIV testing and/or antenatal care..	[[106, 111]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6170	Effective counseling sessions can play a major role in the institution of PMTCT interventions worldwide.	[[74, 79]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml
6171	Additionally, a high proportion of HIV-positive women received PMTCT interventions due to rapid testing in labor.	[[63, 68]]	[]	['PMTCT']	[]	PMC2365974.nxml

6173	Fibrinolytic potential was determined with a plasma-based clot lysis assay in 2,090 patients with venous thrombosis and 2,564 control participants between 18 and 70 y of age enrolled in the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment (MEGA) of risk factors for venous thrombosis study, a population-based case-control study on venous thrombosis.	[[237, 241]]	[]	['MEGA']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6174	Hypofibrinolysis alone, i.e., clot lysis time (CLT) in the fourth quartile (longest CLT) (in absence of the other risk factor of interest) increased thrombosis risk about 2-fold relative to individuals with CLT in the first quartile (shortest CLT).

6175	Oral contraceptive use in women with CLT in the first quartile gave an odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6 to 4.0), while women with hypofibrinolysis who used oral contraceptives had an over 20-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis (OR 21.8, 95% CI 10.2 to 46.7).

6176	For immobilization alone the OR was 4.3 (95% CI 3.2 to 5.8) and immobilization with hypofibrinolysis increased the risk 10.3-fold (95% CI 7.7 to 13.8).	[[45, 47], [135, 137], [29, 31]]	[]	['CI', 'CI', 'OR']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6177	Factor V Leiden alone increased the risk 3.5-fold (95% CI 2.3 to 5.5), and hypofibrinolysis in factor V Leiden carriers gave an OR of 8.1 (95% CI 5.3 to 12.3).	[[55, 57], [143, 145], [128, 130]]	[]	['CI', 'CI', 'OR']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml

6179	A clot that occurs in one of the veins (vessels that take the blood to the heart) deep within the body (usually in the leg) is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).	[[151, 154]]	[[129, 149]]	['DVT']	['deep vein thrombosis']	PMC2365975.nxml
6180	Some DVTs have no symptoms; others cause pain, swelling, and tenderness in one leg.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['DVT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6181	If left untreated, part of the clot (an embolus) can break off and travel to the lungs, where it can cause a life-threatening condition called a pulmonary embolism (PE)..	[[165, 167]]	[[145, 163]]	['PE']	['pulmonary embolism']	PMC2365975.nxml
6182	Most people are very unlikely to develop venous thrombosis (the collective term for DVT and PE), but anything that makes blood “hypercoagulable” (prone to clotting) increases this risk.	[[84, 87], [92, 94]]	[]	['DVT', 'PE']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6183	The researchers collected blood from more than 2,000 individuals after their first DVT or PE and from a similar number of persons without venous thrombosis (controls).	[[83, 86], [90, 92]]	[]	['DVT', 'PE']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6184	For each blood sample, they measured the time it took to dissolve a clot generated from that blood in a test tube (the clot lysis time or CLT) and determined which participants had the factor V Leiden mutation or a genetic change in the clotting factor prothrombin that also increases blood coagulability.	[[138, 141]]	[[119, 134]]	['CLT']	['clot lysis time']	PMC2365975.nxml
6185	The researchers divided the participants into four equal-sized groups (quartiles) based on their CLT and used the quartile with the lowest CLT as the reference group for their statistical analyses; hypofibrinolysis was defined as a CLT in the highest quartile (the longest times).	[[97, 100], [139, 142], [232, 235]]	[]	['CLT', 'CLT', 'CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6186	Participants with hypofibrinolysis alone were twice as likely to develop venous thrombosis as those with a CLT in the lowest quartile (the shortest times).	[[107, 110]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6187	These findings confirm that persons with hypofibrinolysis and hence longer CLTs have a greater risk of developing venous thrombosis than those with short CLTs.	[[75, 78], [154, 157]]	[]	['CLT', 'CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6188	Because CLTs were measured after venous thrombosis had occurred, hypofibrinolysis could be an effect rather than a cause of this condition.	[[8, 11]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml

6255	It is known that BMI is associated with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels [8] and the prothrombin 20210A mutation was found to be associated with increased thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation in a study that used a clot lysis assay similar to that used in our study [9].

6256	We adjusted the ORs in Table 2 for BMI and the prothrombin 20210A mutation to see whether the increased risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with hypofibrinolysis could (in part) be explained by the increase in these fibrinolytic factors.

6260	The risk of venous thrombosis for individuals with hypofibrinolysis was 2.4-fold increased compared with those with CLTs in the first quartile.	[[116, 119]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6261	Furthermore, there was a clear dose-response relation between CLT and the risk of venous thrombosis.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6262	In this case-control study, CLTs above the 90th percentile of the levels found in the control group were associated with an almost 2-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis..	[[28, 31]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6263	In accordance with results previously reported [9], we found that individuals with the prothrombin 20210A mutation had increased CLTs, conceivably related to increased activation of TAFI..	[[129, 132], [182, 186]]	[]	['CLT', 'TAFI']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6264	We found shorter CLTs in women using oral contraceptives compared with women not taking oral contraceptives.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6265	This is in contrast with the results of a crossover study showing no difference in CLT before and during oral contraceptive use [16].	[[83, 86]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6266	In that study, t-PA activity, plasminogen, and plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes were increased during oral contraceptive use, and levels of PAI-1 antigen and activity and t-PA antigen were decreased.	[[140, 145], [15, 19], [171, 175]]	[]	['PAI-1', 't-PA', 't-PA']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6267	It was suggested that this increased fibrinolytic activity is counteracted by the increased TAFI levels that were also found.	[[92, 96]]	[]	['TAFI']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6268	However, a direct comparison of the studies is complicated, because the CLT assays used were slightly different.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6269	In the crossover study, the plasma was clotted with thrombin and t-PA, while in our assay tissue factor and t-PA is used..	[[65, 69], [108, 112]]	[]	['t-PA', 't-PA']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml

6271	It is plausible that PAI-1 plays an important role in these associations, as it is known that PAI-1 is overexpressed in patients with diabetes and obesity (reviewed in [8])..	[[21, 26], [94, 99]]	[]	['PAI-1', 'PAI-1']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6272	In our previous study, we showed that the risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with hypofibrinolysis as measured with our clot lysis assay did not disappear after adjustment for several coagulation factors shown to influence CLTs in the control population [2].	[[229, 232]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6273	This result suggests that the CLTs are mostly determined by fibrinolytic factors.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6274	It is also supported by the association between BMI and CLT and the increased CLTs in individuals with diabetes and those with the prothrombin 20210A mutation.	[[48, 51], [56, 59], [78, 81]]	[]	['BMI', 'CLT', 'CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml
6275	However, when CLT would increase as a result of the event, one would expect such an acute-phase effect to attenuate with time after the thrombotic event.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['CLT']	[]	PMC2365975.nxml

6312	Despite substantial research over many years, understanding prognostic factors for WAD recovery is sparse [1,2].	[[83, 86]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6313	Results from studies of uninjured individuals' perceptions of the symptoms that may arise from WAD and those from mild traumatic head injuries suggest that there are differences between countries in the perceptions of presence and duration of symptoms.	[[95, 98]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6314	Over the past 10–15 y, considerable attention has been given to WAD in the Swedish media.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6315	Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the prognostic value of individuals' expectations for recovery after WAD..	[[122, 125]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6316	We included claimants who met the criteria outlined above, and who (i) reported WAD (defined below), (ii) were not hospitalized for more than 2 d, and (iii) did not have other injury claims reported during the inception period.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6317	Disability was assessed with the seven-item Pain Disability Index (PDI) questionnaire, which ranges from 0 to 70, where 0 is no disability due to pain [14].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['PDI']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6318	Expectations for recovery were measured with a numerical rating scale (NRS 0–10) where the respondents were asked to rate how likely it was that he/she would have a complete recovery.	[[71, 74]]	[[47, 69]]	['NRS']	['numerical rating scale']	PMC2375948.nxml
6319	For the analysis, we reversed the scale and arbitrarily trichotomised it into those who stated that they were less likely to make a full recovery (NRS 5–10), an intermediate category (NRS 1–4), and those who stated that they were very likely to make a full recovery (NRS 0)..

6321	Postcollision symptoms were (i) pain referring to three specified anatomic regions and one option for “other” region, all assessed with numerical rating scales (NRS 0–10); (ii) number of pain areas from pain drawings [15]; and (iii) mental health, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [16,17].

6330	There was a dose response relationship, in that the intermediate category (NRS 1–4) was also associated with severity of disability, but the ORs were smaller.	[[75, 78], [141, 143]]	[]	['NRS', 'OR']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6331	When stratifying the data by mild (NRS 0–4) versus moderate/severe (NRS 5–10) baseline neck pain, we found a stronger effect in the mild neck pain strata.	[[35, 38], [68, 71]]	[]	['NRS', 'NRS']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6332	Expectations for recovery were an important factor in the prognosis of WAD, for both moderate and high disability, with a clear dose response relationship.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6333	Interventions with the goal of changing expectations and beliefs may therefore benefit a large proportion of individuals with WAD..	[[126, 129]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6334	In a recent intervention study in which the authors investigated the efficacy of informational group sessions for high risk patients with mild injuries after traffic collisions (including WAD), the intervention group had a 20% greater recovery rate compared to the group who received “general care” [28].	[[188, 191]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6335	Previous findings from studies on conditions similar to WAD also suggest that individuals' expectations are important factors in recovery and return to work [12,29,30].	[[56, 59]]	[]	['WAD']	[]	PMC2375948.nxml
6336	The substantial influence of initial expectations on subsequent disability, even after considering the impact of baseline pain intensity and other symptoms, might be a partial explanation for anecdotal reports of long term dysfunction in persons with initially mild WAD symptoms..

6338	World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for monitoring HIV-infected individuals taking combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in resource-limited settings recommend using CD4+ T cell (CD4) count changes to monitor treatment effectiveness.

6339	We conducted an observational cohort study among 1,982 of 4,984 (40%) HIV-infected adults initiating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based cART in the Aid for AIDS Disease Management Program, which serves nine countries in southern Africa.	[[154, 158]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6340	Pharmacy refill adherence was calculated as the number of months of cART claims submitted divided by the number of complete months between cART initiation and the last refill prior to the endpoint of interest, expressed as a percentage.	[[68, 72], [139, 143]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6341	The main outcome measure was virologic failure defined as a viral load > 1,000 copies/ml (1) at an initial assessment either 6 or 12 mo after cART initiation and (2) after a previous undetectable (i.e., < 400 copies/ml) viral load (breakthrough viremia).	[[142, 146]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6342	Adherence levels outperformed CD4 count changes when used to detect current virologic failure in the first year after cART initiation (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves [AUC] were 0.79 and 0.68 [difference = 0.11; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; χ2 = 20.1] respectively at 6 mo, and 0.85 and 0.75 [difference = 0.10; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.14; χ2 = 20.2] respectively at 12 mo; p < 0.001 for both comparisons).	[[118, 122], [246, 248], [338, 340]]	[]	['cART', 'CI', 'CI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6343	When used to detect current breakthrough viremia, adherence and CD4 counts were equally accurate (AUCs of 0.68 versus 0.67, respectively [difference = 0.01; 95% CI −0.06 to 0.07]; χ2 = 0.1, p > 0.5).	[[98, 101], [161, 163]]	[]	['AUC', 'CI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6344	In addition, adherence levels assessed 3 mo prior to viral load assessments were as accurate for virologic failure occurring approximately 3 mo later as were CD4 count changes calculated from cART initiation to the actual time of the viral load assessments, indicating the potential utility of adherence assessments for predicting future, rather than simply detecting current, virologic failure.	[[192, 196]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6345	Pharmacy refill adherence assessments were as accurate as CD4 counts for detecting current virologic failure in this cohort of patients on cART and have the potential to predict virologic failure before it occurs.	[[139, 143]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6346	Approaches to cART scale-up in resource-limited settings should include an adherence-based monitoring approach..	[[14, 18]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6347	Today, through the concerted efforts of governments, international organizations, and funding bodies, about a quarter of the HIV-positive people in developing and transitional countries who are in immediate need of life-saving, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) receive the drugs they need..	[[264, 268]]	[[228, 262]]	['cART']	['combination antiretroviral therapy']	PMC2386831.nxml
6348	To maximize the benefits of cART, health-care workers in developing countries need simple, affordable ways to monitor viral suppression in their patients—a poor virologic response to cART can lead to the selection of drug-resistant HIV, rapid disease progression, and death.	[[28, 32], [183, 187]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6349	Instead, the World Health Organization recommends that CD4+ T cell (CD4) counts be used to monitor patient responses to cART in resource-limited settings.	[[120, 124]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6350	On the other hand “adherence lapses”—the failure to take cART regularly—often precede virologic failure, so detecting them early provides an opportunity for improvement in adherence that could prevent virologic failure.	[[57, 61]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6351	Because clinics that dispense cART routinely collect data that can be used to calculate adherence, in this study the researchers investigate whether assessing adherence might provide an alternative, low-cost way to monitor and predict virologic failure among HIV-infected adults on cART..	[[30, 34], [282, 286]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6352	The Aid for AIDS Disease Management Program provides cART to medical insurance fund subscribers in nine countries in southern Africa.	[[53, 57]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6353	Data on claims for antiretroviral drugs made through this program, plus CD4 counts assessed at about 6 or 12 months after initiating cART, and viral load measurements taken within 45 days of a CD4 count, were available for nearly 2,000 HIV-positive adults who had been prescribed a combination of HIV drugs including either efavirenz or nevirapine.	[[133, 137]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6354	The researchers defined adherence as the number of months of cART claims submitted divided by the number of complete months between cART initiation and the last pharmacy refill before a viral load assessment was performed.	[[61, 65], [132, 136]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6355	Virologic failure was defined in two ways: as a viral load of more than 1,000 copies per ml of blood 6 or 12 months after cART initiation, or as a rebound of viral load to similar levels after a previously very low reading (breakthrough viremia).	[[122, 126]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6356	The researchers' statistical analysis of these data shows that at 6 and 12 months after initiation of cART, adherence levels indicated virologic failure more accurately than CD4 count changes.	[[102, 106]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6357	Adherence levels during the first 3 months of cART predicted virologic failure at 6 months as accurately as did CD4 count changes since cART initiation.	[[46, 50], [136, 140]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6358	These findings suggest that adherence assessments (based in this study on insurance claims for pharmacy refills) can identify the patients on cART who are at high and low risk of virologic failure at least as accurately as CD4 counts.	[[142, 146]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6359	Studies need to be done in other settings (in particular, in public clinics where cART is provided without charge) to confirm the generalizability of these findings.	[[82, 86]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6360	These finding do not change that fact that monitoring CD4 counts plays an important role in deciding when to start cART or indicating when cART is no longer protecting the immune system.	[[115, 119], [139, 143]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6361	But, write the researchers, systematic monitoring of adherence to cART should be considered as an alternative to CD4 count monitoring in patients who are receiving cART in resource-limited settings or as a way to direct the use of viral load testing where feasible..	[[66, 70], [164, 168]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6362	As the number of patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) grows worldwide, developing simple, affordable ways of monitoring patients after treatment initiation has become a major public health priority.	[[65, 69]]	[[29, 63]]	['cART']	['combination antiretroviral therapy']	PMC2386831.nxml
6363	Since the central paradigm of antiretroviral therapy is suppression of viral replication, and since costs of second-line cART are higher than first-line regimens [1], monitoring efforts should, as much as possible, focus on preserving the virologic effectiveness of first-line combinations.	[[121, 125]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6364	Since CD4+ T cell (CD4) counts are comparatively inexpensive, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for scaling up antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings advocate use of CD4 count criteria to identify patients on failing cART regimens [7].	[[239, 243], [89, 92]]	[]	['cART', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6365	Thus, CD4 counts are considered an essential tool for monitoring patients on cART [8], and there is a widespread movement to incorporate cheaper, less technologically demanding CD4 count assays into clinical care in the developing world [9]..	[[77, 81]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6366	Quantifying and monitoring adherence to cART is one potentially useful and low-cost method of identifying patients at high risk for virologic failure in resource-limited settings [10].	[[40, 44]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6367	Furthermore, among patients on first-line therapy, lapses in adherence usually precede immunologic declines and, unlike CD4 count data, adherence data available to all clinics that dispense cART may be simple to compile [10].	[[190, 194]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6368	Therefore, although CD4 count monitoring in patients on cART is deeply ingrained in HIV care [5,7], if adherence assessments are as accurate as CD4 count changes for identification of patients with virologic failure, sites currently performing or planning CD4 count measurements for this purpose could instead choose to monitor adherence, thereby preserving scarce resources for triaged virologic monitoring [17,18] or other treatment-related activities..	[[56, 60]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6369	Despite the potential time and cost savings of this method, the diagnostic accuracy of various adherence levels for predicting virologic failure has not been determined, and current WHO guidelines for monitoring cART in resource-limited settings include only general recommendations for assessing adherence and no detail about the levels of adherence that should trigger interventions [7].	[[212, 216], [182, 185]]	[]	['cART', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6370	To address this information gap, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of CD4 cell count changes and adherence measurements for virologic failure on cART..	[[147, 151]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6371	Assessments of this outcome were considered in two ways: (1) lack of virologic response (defined as a viral load >1,000 copies/ml) either 6 or 12 mo after cART initiation, and (2) breakthrough viremia, as demonstrated by a follow-up viral load >1,000 copies/ml after achievement of an undetectable (i.e., < 400 copies/ml) viral load.	[[155, 159]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6372	Lack of response within the first year was chosen as an outcome because of the clinical relevance of initial response to cART on subsequent disease outcomes [19], and breakthrough viremia was chosen as an outcome because several studies have reported that a majority of patients initiating cART achieve viral loads < 400 copies/ml within the first year [19–22].	[[121, 125], [290, 294]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6373	Claims include the drug names and date of the prescription refill, and drugs are dispensed in uniform increments of 30 d of an entire cART regimen each time a prescription is refilled.	[[134, 138]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6374	Patients who met the following general criteria were eligible: (1) age ≥ 18 y; (2) pretreatment plasma viral load level of > 2,000 copies/ml; (3) initiated non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based cART, a criterion chosen because of its relevance to resource-limited settings [23,24] and defined as an NNRTI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; and (4) CD4 count and viral load assessment within 90 d prior to or on the day of therapy initiation.	[[217, 221], [204, 209], [322, 327]]	[[156, 202]]	['cART', 'NNRTI', 'NNRTI']	['non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor']	PMC2386831.nxml
6375	In addition, for the evaluation of treatment response at 6 and 12 mo, patients needed: (1) a follow-up CD4 count within 3–9 or 9–15 mo after initiating cART, respectively, and (2) a follow-up viral load within 45 d of the corresponding follow-up CD4 count.	[[152, 156]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6376	The analysis of breakthrough viremia was limited to patients meeting general criteria who also had (1) at least one undetectable viral load obtained after cART initiation, (2) a subsequent follow-up viral load obtained at least 30 d after the first undetectable viral load, and (3) a CD4 count obtained within at least 45 d of this follow-up viral load.	[[155, 159]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6377	Adherence was calculated as the number of months with cART claims submitted, divided by the number of complete months from cART commencement to the date of the relevant study endpoint, and the result multiplied by 100, as described [12,16].	[[54, 58], [123, 127]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6378	Since patients fill entire cART regimens with each refill, we tracked the entire regimen rather than using an “index drug” approach, which tracks only a single drug of a regimen..	[[27, 31]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6379	A relative risk for the primary exposures (e.g., CD4 count criteria and adherence level) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined and then evaluated in multivariable logistic regression analysis (which produced odds ratios [ORs]) to assess possible confounding.	[[121, 123], [234, 236]]	[[100, 119], [221, 231]]	['CI', 'OR']	['confidence interval', 'odds ratio']	PMC2386831.nxml
6380	Confounding was considered present if the unadjusted OR changed by 15% or more after adjustment.	[[53, 55]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6381	For uniformity, all presented ORs are adjusted values..	[[30, 32]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6382	Overall diagnostic accuracy of adherence and CD4 count changes were expressed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 95% CIs.	[[139, 141], [119, 122]]	[[84, 117]]	['CI', 'ROC']	['receiver operating characteristic']	PMC2386831.nxml
6383	Larger areas under the ROC curve (AUC) indicate greater overall ability to discriminate between patients with and without virologic failure.	[[34, 37], [23, 26]]	[]	['AUC', 'ROC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6384	For tests with binary outcomes (e.g., presence or absence of virologic failure), the area under the ROC curve is equal to the c (for concordance) statistic [26].	[[100, 103]]	[]	['ROC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6385	p-Values for the primary comparison of AUCs at 6 and 12 mo and for breakthrough viremia were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['AUC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6386	Furthermore, we used bootstrap resampling to evaluate the robustness of our findings by resampling with replacement observations from the original dataset 999 times, which produced 95% CIs for the mean difference in AUCs [29].	[[216, 219], [185, 187]]	[]	['AUC', 'CI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6387	In addition, AUCs for ROC curves derived from rules created using specific criteria are presented to enable rapid evaluation of overall diagnostic accuracy of each criterion with respect to others, and to permit comparison of these ROC areas with a reference test of a CD4 count decrease to pretreatment levels or below.	[[13, 16], [22, 25], [232, 235]]	[]	['AUC', 'ROC', 'ROC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6388	Specifically, we determined the accuracy of adherence assessments performed approximately 3 mo prior to a viral load assessment for virologic failure and compared this estimate of accuracy with that resulting from assessments of CD4 count changes calculated from the time of cART initiation to the time the viral load was done (e.g., 3 mo later).	[[275, 279]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6389	This was done for analyses of virologic failure at 6 and 12 mo, and statistically was performed by comparing AUCs as in the primary analysis.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['AUC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6390	Adherence in the first 3 mo of cART was compared with the CD4 count change from cART initiation to the time of the 6-mo viral load.	[[31, 35], [80, 84]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6391	These results were analyzed by computing the exact binomial 95% CIs for these test characteristics and proportions and comparing these to characteristics of adherence or CD4 count changes alone..	[[64, 66]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6392	There were 5,723 adults who initiated cART and had registration information included in the Aid for AIDS database used in this study.	[[38, 42]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml

6422	Use of an adherence threshold alone of 100% at both 6 and 12 mo resulted in NPVs of 91% (88%–93%) and 94% (91%–97%), respectively.	[[76, 79]]	[]	['NPV']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6423	Two criteria, adherence ≥ 70% or ≥ 80% and a CD4 count increase of ≥ 50 cells/μl at 6 mo maintained the point estimate for NPV above 90% while increasing the proportion of patients meeting that criterion at 6 mo (Table 7).	[[123, 126]]	[]	['NPV']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6424	At 12 mo, several criteria that maintained NPVs at or above 94% while significantly increasing the proportion of patients meeting that criterion were identified (indicated by footnotes in the “12 Mo” column in Table 7)..	[[43, 46]]	[]	['NPV']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6425	Because cART scale-up guidelines for resource-limited settings suggest use of CD4 count monitoring after cART initiation [7], these findings are relevant to ongoing antiretroviral treatment efforts in resource-limited settings..	[[8, 12], [105, 109]]	[]	['cART', 'cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6426	As shown, the ROC curve analyses indicate that given a fixed level of sensitivity, specificity resulting from monitoring adherence will tend to be higher than that seen with WHO-advocated CD4 count changes in the first year and approximately equivalent thereafter.	[[14, 17], [174, 177]]	[]	['ROC', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6427	Furthermore, the fact that the ROC areas for adherence measured months prior to a viral load were relatively consistent with adherence assessments and CD4 count changes performed later indicates that adherence monitoring may be a useful approach for early identification of patients at high risk of future virologic failure.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['ROC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6428	Therefore, although detection of a CD4 count decline would be unlikely to lead to a treatment change in the first year of cART, detection of adherence lapses early may enable targeted adherence interventions capable of preventing virologic failure [31,32] and prolonging time on less-expensive first-line cART.	[[122, 126]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6429	The high NPVs resulting from adherence monitoring indicate that adherence data can be used to identify a relatively large group of patients who have a low probability of virologic failure.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['NPV']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6430	However, although the NNRTI-based cART regimens used and the immunologic responses were similar to those found in several other cohorts [17,21–23], this study was performed in a private-care setting, so the potential generalizability of the results should also be considered.	[[34, 38], [22, 27]]	[]	['cART', 'NNRTI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6431	For example, the adherence calculation was based on claims, and patients receiving cART at free clinics do not generally submit pharmacy claims.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['cART']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6432	In addition, alternative measures of adherence, including subjective measures that were not available to us [34,35], should be examined, as should accuracy of this approach in patients on non-NNRTI-based cART.	[[192, 197]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6433	Finally, the AUC for adherence assessments for virologic failure was lower in the analysis of breakthrough viremia compared to the AUCs for adherence assessments for virologic failure done at 6 and 12 months after HAART initiation.	[[13, 16], [131, 134]]	[]	['AUC', 'AUC']	[]	PMC2386831.nxml
6434	Although CD4 counts inform when to start antiretroviral therapy and when to stop prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, these data indicate that guidelines such as those produced by the WHO [7] for monitoring patients receiving cART in resource-limited settings should include consideration of an adherence-based monitoring approach..

6446	Notably, expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) was markedly repressed in the 5′UTR-expressing tumors, resulting in down-regulation of a STAT1-responsive cluster of genes (43 genes).	[[116, 119]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml

6529	It should be noted that anti-VEGF165-neutralizing monoclonal Ab could not completely cancel the anti-apoptotic activity even at concentrations of up to 5 μg/ml (about 250 molar excess amount of secreted VEGF165) (Figure 1C).	[[61, 63]]	[]	['Ab']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml

6553	We also examined whether the vegf 5′UTR similarly induce the chemoresistance in other human cancer cell lines (RKO, HEK293, and AGS cells), and confirmed that both full-length vegf mRNA and vegf 5′UTR RNA induced 5-FU resistance in these cells.

6560	To investigate chronic effects of the vegf mRNA 5′UTR on malignant transformation of HCT116 cells both in vitro and in vivo, we established stable transfectants that expressed chimeric mRNAs of either the vegf 5′UTR or the mutant one (as described above) fused to the YFP coding gene.

6609	Treatment with rhIFNα or rhIFNγ alone did not induce apoptosis in any of the clones tested, while both IFNα and IFNγ significantly enhanced 5-FU-induced apoptosis in the HCT116/vegf 5′mut cells or the HCT116/YFP cells (Figure 5E and 5F).	[[140, 144], [208, 211]]	[]	['5-FU', 'YFP']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml

6626	HCT116/vegf 5′ cells, but not HCT116/vegf 5′mut cells, showed anchorage-independent growth in vitro and rapidly grew when implanted in athymic nude mice, indicating that vegf mRNA 5′UTR facilitates tumor progression.	[[182, 185]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6627	Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that expression of pro-apoptotic genes (fas, pdcd1, nrg1, and bax) and an anti-apoptotic gene (mia) was up-regulated and markedly down-regulated, respectively, in the rapidly growing vegf 5′-tumors.	[[28, 34]]	[]	['RT-PCR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6628	Thus, we consider that the vegf 5′UTR may increase the ability not only to suppress apoptosis but also to survive and grow in an anchorage-independent manner, resulting in the acceleration of tumor formation..	[[34, 37]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6629	The precise sequence and structure of the 5′UTR of vegf mRNA as well as the molecular target(s) that interact with the RNA remain to be elucidated.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6630	Our results support this notion by showing that the vegf mRNA 5′UTR modulated expression of numerous genes.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6631	One of the striking findings is that many of the down-regulated genes belong to a set of IFN-inducible genes, including stat1..	[[89, 92]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6632	Since it is reported that IFN down-regulates IRES-dependent translation of distinct mRNAs [38], overexpression of the IRES-containing 5′UTR might attenuate the IFN signal, leading to the down-regulation of IFN-inducible genes.

6633	At the same time, we also confirmed that IFNα signaling, estimated using the ISRE-dependent transcription reporter assay, was not inhibited in the cells overexpressing bip, c-myc, or fgf-2 5′UTR, nor was it inhibited in the cells overexpressing the pdgf-b 5′UTR that have no IRES activity (Figure S7D).

6635	The IFNs/STAT1 signal is one of the key pathways for tumor suppression.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6636	Indeed, the majority of cancer cell lines and primary tumors are resistant to IFNs, often through inhibition of STAT1 expression [42,43].	[[78, 81]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6637	We propose here that the vegf mRNA 5′UTR negatively regulates expression of STAT1, leading to suppression of STAT1-dependent transcriptional activities.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['UTR']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6638	Tumor cell growth and survival may require both expression of VEGF and down-regulation of the IFN pathway.	[[94, 97], [62, 66]]	[]	['IFN', 'VEGF']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6639	Consistent with this notion, it is known that IFNα transcriptionally suppresses VEGF expression [44,45].	[[80, 84]]	[]	['VEGF']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6640	In contrast, we suggest here that vegf mRNA may negatively regulate the IFN signaling pathway by repressing STAT1.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC2386836.nxml
6641	This reciprocal regulation of VEGF and STAT1 is entirely feasible as these two molecules exert opposing biological functions: VEGF promotes proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis [1–4], and inhibits apoptosis [1]; in contrast, STAT1 negatively regulates proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis [41,46], and promotes apoptosis [33,47].

6686	The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of skin tumors [1], which is an extension of the revised Sydney classification from 1986 [2–4], distinguishes four main types of melanoma; superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), nodular melanoma (NM), and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).

[[226, 228]]	[]	['NM']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6688	Cases were classified into SSM, LMM, NM, and, ALM according to the WHO classification, or not classifiable (NC) if they did not fit unequivocally in any of these categories [2,3,18].

6691	For melanomas that were classified as NMs in the WHO classification applying the three-rete ridge rule, the assessment was made in any small intraepidermal component adjacent to the nodular portion wherever possible.	[[38, 40], [49, 52]]	[]	['NM', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6692	Pigmentation was assessed in three different ways: maximum pigmentation anywhere in the tumor; average pigmentation across all sections of the RGP; and average pigmentation across all sections of the vertical growth phase (VGP).	[[143, 146]]	[]	['RGP']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6693	The contour of the epidermis involved by the RGP of the melanoma was compared to the adjacent normal epidermis (Figure S1A) and scored from 0 to 4: 0, (atrophic) markedly thinned epidermis with effacement of rete ridges; 1, (thinned) thinned epidermis with partial attenuation of rete ridges; 2, (normal) epidermal silhouette similar to the adjacent uninvolved epidermis; 3, (thickened) slight to moderate epidermal hyperplasia with elongation of the rete ridges resulting in a maximum 2-fold increase in epidermal thickness; 4, (hyperplastic) marked epidermal hyperplasia resulting in a greater than 2-fold increase in epidermal thickness..

6695	The unordered categorical variables (anatomic site, WHO type, non-CSD, CSD, Acral grouping [11], and gender) were treated as factor variables in logistic regression.	[[66, 69], [52, 55]]	[]	['CSD', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml

6697	The phenotypic characteristics that we focused on in our measurements comprised “elementary” features that mostly are combined in various ways in the WHO classification.	[[150, 153]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6698	For example, in the WHO classification the features “lentiginous” and “pagetoid” growth are prominently used as opposing ends of a spectrum of intraepidermal growth.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6699	Similar to the WHO classification, we focused our evaluation of the features primarily on the early progression phases, e.g., the RGP of the tumor in the expectation that this would be the most informative regarding its “histogenetic” origin..	[[130, 133], [15, 18]]	[]	['RGP', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6700	Figure 2 shows a heatmap of features by mutation status (Figure 2A) and by the WHO subtypes (Figure 2B)..	[[79, 82]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml

6702	Since most of the features are assessed as ordinal variables, the ORs reflect the increase (or decrease) of the odds per unit increment.	[[66, 68]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6703	For example in the comparison of nesting between melanomas with and without BRAF mutations (first column), the OR of 3.11 indicates the increase in odds for one increment of the ordinal scale for scatter (e.g., nesting 1 to nesting 2).	[[111, 113]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6704	To calculate the odds for an increment of two the indicated OR should be squared.	[[60, 62]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6705	In addition, the epidermis of the RGP of melanomas with BRAF mutations was more commonly thickened compared to the surrounding skin, i.e., the score for the “epidermal contour” had a higher average value, and the transition from the tumor into the surrounding skin tended to be more abrupt than in melanomas without BRAF mutations, i.e., “lateral circumscription” had a higher average score.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['RGP']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6706	(B) The prediction tree for BRAF mutation using the variables of age, sex, body site, and WHO type also recorded in melanoma registries identifies an age cutoff of 55 y as the single best predictor of BRAF mutation status.	[[90, 93]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6707	While the elementary morphological characteristics that contribute to the WHO classification system have a very strong relationship to BRAF mutation status, the WHO categories were not independently associated with BRAF mutation status since mutations are found in considerable proportions of all WHO categories, with the exception of ALM, Table 1, and Figure 2.	[[335, 338], [74, 77], [161, 164], [297, 300]]	[]	['ALM', 'WHO', 'WHO', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6708	The strong relationship of the elementary characteristics to mutation status is emphasized by the fact that the same associations remained significant when the analyses were restricted to individual WHO categories, where the proportion of mutations ranged from 13% in the Acral category to 52% in the SSM category (Table S7).	[[301, 304], [199, 202]]	[]	['SSM', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6709	However, gender, patient age, WHO subtype, site of primary tumor, tumor thickness, and presence or absence of ulceration are routinely recorded in registries.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6710	In this study we demonstrate that histopathological features of the primary tumor, many of which have been part of the WHO classification, provide substantial information on the mutation status of an important melanoma gene, BRAF.	[[119, 122]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6711	In the univariate analysis the majority of the OR point estimates for association with NRAS mutation are close to one, and so if true associations are present we would expect them to be much weaker than for BRAF.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6712	We have recently described activation of KIT by mutation and/or copy number increases in mucosal, acral, and CSD melanomas [13].	[[109, 112]]	[]	['CSD']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6713	The increase in knowledge of underlying causative genetic alterations in melanoma offers an opportunity to reassess the syndromic classification scheme that emerged from the Sydney classification [3] and its revision [4] into the current WHO classification.	[[238, 241]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408611.nxml
6714	The observation that simple combinations of features could predict BRAF mutation status independent of, and even within WHO subtypes, indicates that the morphological criteria we used can be employed to refine the existing classification, providing an opportunity to identify disease subsets that are genetically more homogenous.

6724	The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimate that 68% of 2.5 million new infections worldwide in 2007 took place in sub-Saharan Africa, where 76% of 2.1 million AIDS-related deaths also took place..

6729	If surgery were to be unsafe in HIV-positive men, these individuals might have to either be excluded from adult MC programs, which would be potentially stigmatizing, or they might require specialized services for postoperative care, which could add to program costs and complexity..

6751	Only seven of the HIV-positive men (1.7%) and 31 of the HIV-negative men (1.3%) experienced more than one AE, and one HIV-negative man had three AEs.	[[106, 108], [145, 147]]	[]	['AE', 'AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml

6760	Early resumption of intercourse was associated with an increased risk of all surgery-related AEs in HIV-negative and HIV-positive men, although this was statistically significant only for the HIV-uninfected.	[[93, 95]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6761	Early resumption of intercourse prior to wound healing is of programmatic concern because HIV-infected men who resumed sex before wound healing were more likely to infect their female partners (see Discussion) [9], so we assessed the frequency of AEs for both groups combined.	[[247, 249]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6762	The AdjOR of any AE associated with resumption of sex before certified wound healing was 1.56 (95% CI 1.05–2.34, p = 0.029).	[[4, 9], [17, 19], [99, 101]]	[]	['AdjOR', 'AE', 'CI']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6763	However, early resumption of intercourse was not associated with increased moderate or severe AEs (AdjOR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.42–1.63)..	[[99, 104], [94, 96], [117, 119]]	[]	['AdjOR', 'AE', 'CI']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml

6765	We found that the risks of moderate or severe AEs following adult MC were 3.1% in HIV-infected and 3.5% in HIV-negative men.	[[46, 48], [66, 68]]	[]	['AE', 'MC']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6766	Thus, we conclude that circumcision performed by adequately trained and equipped medical personnel is likely to be safe in HIV-infected men with WHO stage I or II disease and with a CD4 count > 350 cells/mm3.	[[145, 148]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6767	It is difficult to compare complication rates following adult MC between the three trials of circumcision for HIV prevention [1–3] or case series [7,8] because of differences in AE definitions, and in methods used for detection of AEs and for reporting of events.	[[178, 180], [231, 233], [62, 64]]	[]	['AE', 'AE', 'MC']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6768	Further, with the exception of the three HIV prevention trials reported to date [1–3], adult MC is usually performed for medical indications, and the underlying medical conditions (e.g., balanitis, phimosis, ulceration) may contribute to postoperative morbidity.	[[93, 95]]	[]	['MC']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6769	Adult MC complication rates reported in the literature range from 2% to 10% in HIV-negative men [8].	[[6, 8]]	[]	['MC']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6770	Among HIV-negative men, the rates of surgery-related AEs were 1.7% in the Kenyan trial [2] (although an earlier publication reported a rate of 3.5% [7]), and 3.6% in the South African trial [3].	[[53, 55]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6771	These rates are compatible with moderate and severe events observed in the present study, but lower than the total AEs observed here (Table 2).	[[115, 117]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6772	However, differences in methods of ascertainment and diagnosis make strict comparisons of AEs between these trials problematic.	[[90, 92]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6773	For example, in the present study in a rural area, AEs were detected by clinical officers mainly during field visits.	[[51, 53]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6774	Review of the AEs suggested that the clinical officers were concerned about access to health services in this setting and tended to overtreat and possibly overdiagnose minor complications.	[[14, 16]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6775	In the South African and Kenyan trials ascertainment of AEs occurred in a central clinic and in settings with better access to services.	[[56, 58]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6776	The circumcision trial in South Africa reported a surgery-related AE rate of 8.2% in 73 HIV-infected men [3], which is similar to the total AE rate of 6.0% observed in the present trial (Table 2)..	[[66, 68], [140, 142]]	[]	['AE', 'AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6777	Inclusion of HIV-positive men in future circumcision programs could avoid potential stigmatization and may be of benefit to these men by reducing GUD [9].	[[146, 149]]	[]	['GUD']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6778	Although the addition of VCT to circumcision programs is highly desirable, under WHO/UNAIDS guidelines it would not have to be a mandatory precondition for provision of safe surgery [4], and this could reduce barriers for persons unwilling to be tested for HIV, as well as reduce the costs and complexity of circumcision services.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['VCT']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6779	An additional finding of programmatic relevance is that resumption of sex before completed wound healing was associated with increased AEs, and that wound healing was complete for more than 90% of participants by 6 wk postoperatively.	[[135, 137]]	[]	['AE']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml
6780	In summary, our findings suggest that circumcision is as safe in HIV-infected men with WHO stage I or II or CD4 counts > 350 cells/mm3, as in uninfected men, and the rates of moderate or severe AEs are acceptably low.	[[194, 196], [87, 90]]	[]	['AE', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2408615.nxml

6815	In previous studies, methylation has been observed to result in a functional loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for heterozygously mutated genes such as p16 where the mutated allele is expressed [27].	[[101, 104]]	[[77, 99]]	['LOH']	['loss of heterozygosity']	PMC2429944.nxml
6816	However, we did not observe this to be the case with the majority of the CAN genes currently under study.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['CAN']	[]	PMC2429944.nxml
6817	We actually observed that for five out of 11 breast CAN genes, mutation and methylation converged in the same tumor (Figure 7A).	[[52, 55]]	[]	['CAN']	[]	PMC2429944.nxml

6820	Thus, the 18 genes we have identified are genes that are found to be mutated in breast and colon cancer, silenced by hypermethylation in these tumors, and reside at locations subject to LOH or deletion in a number of human neoplasms..	[[186, 189]]	[]	['LOH']	[]	PMC2429944.nxml

6822	These relationships are highlighted by the fact that, when we also analyzed a number of CAN genes that we directly determined to not have altered methylation expression levels in breast or colon cancers (including GGA1, PTPN14, ABCB8, OTOF, SIX4, SLCO1B3, and HIST1H1B), the clinical endpoints we mentioned above were not associated with decreased expression of any of these genes..

6843	We calculated YLL using age- and disease-specific deaths, and YLD using estimates of incidence and duration of nonfatal diseases for Mexico and for the low-mortality countries in the World Health Organization Region of the Americas (AMR-B), and disability weights for each disease from the GBD study [20].

6846	In summary, to calculate deaths and disease burden attributable to a risk factor, we first calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for each disease affected by each risk factor.	[[140, 143]]	[[106, 138]]	['PAF']	['population attributable fraction']	PMC2429945.nxml
6847	Inputs to the PAF calculation are (i) current distribution of exposure to a risk factor, (ii) relative risks for each disease caused by the risk factor, and (iii) a counterfactual distribution of exposure to which current exposure is compared.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['PAF']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml

6849	Deaths, YLL, and YLD from each disease attributable to each risk factor were calculated by multiplying PAF by total mortality, YLL, or YLD from that disease.	[[103, 106], [17, 20], [135, 138], [8, 11], [127, 130]]	[]	['PAF', 'YLD', 'YLD', 'YLL', 'YLL']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6850	The attributable deaths and DALYs were summed across all diseases and injuries affected by each risk factor.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml

6852	After adjustment for inconsistent cause of death assignment, 9.7% of deaths were caused by diabetes, with particularly high mortality in the MCMA and Pacific Central regions (4.9 per 10,000; all disease rates are age-standardized to Mexico's population in 2000; Figure 2).	[[141, 145]]	[]	['MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6853	Liver cirrhosis mortality was high throughout Mexico, but there were variations across regions, with mortality in the Southern and Gulf regions nearly twice the Northern region and the MCMA (3.7 and 3.2 per 10,000 MCMA versus 1.7 and 2.1 per 10,000).	[[185, 189], [214, 218]]	[]	['MCMA', 'MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6854	The death rate from group I diseases in the Southern region (8.7 per 10,000) was nearly twice those in the Pacific Central region and the MCMA (5.1 and 5.2 per 10,000).	[[138, 142]]	[]	['MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6855	Group II diseases accounted for 68% of DALYs nationally and many noncommunicable diseases were among the leading causes of disease burden (Table 1).	[[39, 43]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6856	This occurred because group I diseases disproportionately affect children, and injuries mainly affect young adults, both resulting in relatively large YLLs compared to noncommunicable diseases.	[[151, 154]]	[]	['YLL']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6857	In every region and state, noncommunicable diseases caused the majority of DALYs, ranging from 63% in the Southern region to 72% in the MCMA and Pacific Central regions.	[[75, 79], [136, 140]]	[]	['DALY', 'MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6858	Although the proportion of disease burden from group II diseases was lowest in the Southern region, their absolute effect, measured as DALYs per 1,000 population, was highest there (104 per 1,000 versus 96–98 per 1,000 in other regions; Figure 2).	[[135, 139]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6859	With the exception of liver cirrhosis, there was little variability in group II DALY rates among the other regions.	[[80, 84]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6860	A comparison of the leading causes of disease burden by region shows the regional disparities in maternal and child diseases: in the Southern region, birth asphyxia and lower respiratory infections were the first and third leading causes of disease burden, respectively, with about twice as many DALYs per 1,000 population as the national average.	[[296, 300]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6861	The rate of road traffic deaths was lowest in the MCMA, a highly motorized region (2.9 per 100,000 versus 4.1 per 100,000 nationally), and was also low in a highly motorized, wealthy state (Nuevo León; 3.1 per 100,000).	[[50, 54]]	[]	['MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6862	These were followed by the MCMA and states in the Northwest of Mexico..	[[27, 31]]	[]	['MCMA']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6863	Jointly, alcohol use, high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high cholesterol, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking, and high blood glucose accounted for an estimated 36% of deaths and 16% of disease burden.	[[65, 68]]	[[48, 63]]	['BMI']	['body mass index']	PMC2429945.nxml
6864	Among these risks, alcohol use, high blood glucose, and high BMI were responsible for the largest disease burden (Table 1), in aggregate as well as in young and middle-aged adults (15–60 y).	[[61, 64]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6865	Fasting blood glucose levels (age-standardized mean of 5.5 mmol/l for men and 5.6 mmol/l for women) and BMI (27.6 kg/m2 for men and 29.1 kg/m2 for women) in Mexico were among the highest observed worldwide [33,34].	[[104, 107]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6866	Mortality and burden of disease caused by high blood cholesterol and tobacco smoking were relatively low in comparison to those associated with high BMI, blood glucose, and blood pressure (Table 1).	[[149, 152]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6867	These risks together were responsible for 2.3% of all deaths and 2.7% of disease burden (10.1% of deaths and 8.9% of DALYs under 5 y of age).	[[117, 121]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6868	Unlike in other states, in Chiapas the burden of disease attributable to childhood and maternal underweight (4.9 DALYs per 1,000 population) was nearly as large as that of high blood glucose and high BMI (5.1 and 5.0 DALYs per 1,000)..	[[200, 203], [113, 117], [217, 221]]	[]	['BMI', 'DALY', 'DALY']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6869	Mirroring these disease patterns, the highest mortality and burden of disease were caused by the high blood glucose, high BMI, and alcohol use risk factors, with lower burden of disease attributable to tobacco smoking, which was primarily due to lower exposure to tobacco.	[[122, 125]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6870	This finding of the highest mortality and disease burden shows the need for further research on the role of genetic, dietary, and other environmental and health system factors as determinants of high blood glucose and high BMI in Mexico..	[[223, 226]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6871	First, while we used high-quality mortality and risk factor data, substantially less data were available to estimate disease incidence and duration, which are used to calculate the disability associated with nonfatal outcomes (i.e., YLDs).	[[233, 236]]	[]	['YLD']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6872	As a result of these data limitations, for most diseases we relied partially or entirely on regional incidence rates from the GBD study, which incorporated data sources from Mexico as well as other countries, rather than relying exclusively on Mexican data.	[[126, 129]]	[]	['GBD']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6873	Given the importance diseases associated with high BMI and blood glucose, further analysis of dietary patterns and risk factors should be a research priority in Mexico.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2429945.nxml
6874	Relative risks, which quantify the proportional relationship between exposure and outcome, have been shown to be consistent across populations for most risk factors and diseases [27]; yet further analyses of heterogeneity, especially for relationships such as high BMI and diabetes or alcohol use and liver cirrhosis would reduce the uncertainty of our results.

6961	Over the years, there was a significant decrease in the rate of SM (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7–0.8), with a clear step observed from 2000 onward, probably as a consequence of the new treatment policy that was introduced in that year (adding SP to amodiaquine or chloroquine)..

6969	The mechanism for the higher proportion of SM among patients with mixed infections might be a higher overall parasite load.	[[43, 45]]	[]	['SM']	[]	PMC2429951.nxml

6984	The provision of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in resource-limited settings follows a public health approach, which is characterised by a limited number of regimens and the standardisation of clinical and laboratory monitoring.	[[55, 60]]	[[17, 53]]	['HAART']	['highly active antiretroviral therapy']	PMC2443185.nxml
6985	We compared virologic response, changes to first-line regimens, and mortality in HIV-infected patients starting HAART in South Africa and Switzerland..	[[112, 117]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6986	We analysed data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and two HAART programmes in townships of Cape Town, South Africa.	[[57, 62]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6987	Mortality was higher in South Africa than in Switzerland during the first months of HAART: adjusted hazard ratios were 5.90 (95% CI 1.81–19.2) during months 1–3 and 1.77 (0.90–3.50) during months 4–24..	[[129, 131], [84, 89]]	[]	['CI', 'HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6988	Compared to the highly individualised approach in Switzerland, programmatic HAART in South Africa resulted in similar virologic outcomes, with relatively few changes to initial regimens.	[[76, 81]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6989	Further innovation and resources are required in South Africa to both achieve more timely access to HAART and improve the prognosis of patients who start HAART with advanced disease..	[[100, 105], [154, 159]]	[]	['HAART', 'HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6990	Then, in 1996, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)—a combination of several antiretroviral drugs—was developed.	[[53, 58]]	[[15, 51]]	['HAART']	['highly active antiretroviral therapy']	PMC2443185.nxml
6991	Initially, these countries could not afford to provide HAART for their populations.	[[55, 60]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6992	In 2003, however, governments, international agencies, and funding bodies began to implement plans to increase HAART coverage in developing countries.	[[111, 116]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6993	However, instead of individualized treatment, HAART programs in developing countries follow a public-health approach developed by the World Health Organization.	[[46, 51]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6994	This public-health approach takes into account the realities of under-resourced health systems, but is it as effective as the individualized approach? The researchers addressed this question by comparing virologic responses (the effect of treatment on the viral load), changes to first-line (initial) therapy, and deaths in patients receiving HAART in South Africa (public-health approach) and in Switzerland (individualized approach)..	[[343, 348]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6995	The researchers analyzed data collected since 2001 from more than 2,000 patients enrolled in HAART programs in two townships (Gugulethu and Khayelitsha) in Cape Town, South Africa, and from more than 1,000 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a nationwide study of HIV-infected people.	[[93, 98]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6996	These findings suggest that the public-health approach to HAART practiced in South Africa is as effective in terms of virologic outcomes as the individualized approach practiced in Switzerland.	[[58, 63]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6997	Thus, these findings support the continued rollout of the public-health approach to HAART in resource-poor countries.	[[84, 89]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6998	Conversely, they also suggest that a more standardized approach to HAART could be taken in Switzerland (and in other industrialized countries) without compromising its effectiveness.	[[67, 72]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
6999	Finally, the higher mortality in South Africa than in Switzerland, which partly reflects the many patients in South Africa in desperate need of HAART and their more advanced disease at the start of therapy, suggests that HIV-infected patients in South Africa and in other resource-limited countries would benefit from earlier initiation of therapy..	[[144, 149]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7000	The introduction of highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) since 1996 has substantially improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients in industrialized countries [1].	[[70, 75]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7001	Only few drugs were available initially, but today over 20 approved antiretroviral drugs from four drug classes are available, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and fusion inhibitors.

7022	Changes to the initial regimen during the first 2 y of HAART were considerably more frequent in Switzerland than in South Africa: 539 patients (53.1%) compared to 514 patients (21.9%) experienced at least one change during the first 2 y of HAART.	[[55, 60]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml

7028	For toxicity the most notable difference relates to elevated lactate levels and lactic acidosis: in Khayelitsha and Gugulethu 32 (13.4%) of all regimen changes due to toxicities were due to lactic acidosis (associated with d4T in 31 patients).	[[223, 226]]	[]	['d4T']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7029	Reasons for Change of the First HAART Regimen in the First Two Years of Treatment in Khayelitsha and Gugulethu, South Africa and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.	[[32, 37]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7030	During follow-up HIV-1 RNA was measured at regular time intervals in South Africa (median 3.9 mo, IQR 3.2–6.0 mo) whereas in Switzerland the time intervals were not well defined (2.9 mo, 1.9–3.4 mo).	[[98, 101]]	[]	['IQR']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7031	Kaplan-Meier plots show that in both settings most patients suppressed HIV-1 RNA to 500 copies/ml or less (Figure 3, top graph) within one year: 96.0% (95% CI 95.1%–96.9%) of patients in the townships and 95.5% (94.0%–96.7%) in the Swiss cohort.	[[156, 158]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7032	Among the 2,644 patients who suppressed viral replication to ≤500 copies/ml (1,716 in South Africa and 928 in Switzerland), the probability of a viral rebound at 2 y after suppression was 25.5% (95% CI 22.1%–29.3%) in South Africa and 27.1% (23.9%–30.7%) in Switzerland (Figure 3, middle graph).	[[199, 201]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7033	During the 2 y the median CD4 count increased from 80 cells/μl at baseline (IQR 30–138) to 372 cells/μl (260–497) in South Africa and from 204 cells/μl (122–291) to 449 (310–607) in Switzerland.	[[76, 79]]	[]	['IQR']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml

7035	Mortality was substantially higher in South Africa than in Switzerland during the first months of HAART (Figure 3, bottom graph).	[[98, 103]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7036	Cumulative mortality at 6 mo was 8.6% (95% CI 7.5%–9.8%) and 0.9% (0.5%–1.8%), respectively.	[[43, 45]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7037	The proportion of patients lost to follow-up was similar: by 1 y, 3.5% (95% CI 2.5%–4.7%) of patients in Khayelitsha and Gugulethu and 3.2% (2.2%–4.7%) of patients in the Swiss cohort were lost to follow-up..	[[76, 78]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7038	The adjusted HRs comparing South Africa with Switzerland for treatment change due to failure, intolerance, and other reasons were 0.25 (95% CI 0.12–0.50), 0.44 (0.32–0.60), and 0.30 (0.22–0.40) respectively, but there was little evidence for a difference in virologic response and viral rebound (Table 3).	[[140, 142]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7039	In contrast, HRs for the mortality endpoints were attenuated considerably in multivariable analysis: the adjusted HRs were 5.90 (95% CI 1.81–19.21) during months 1–3 and 1.77 (0.90–3.50) during months 4–24.	[[133, 135]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7040	The expected non-HIV-related mortality rate was 28.1 per 10,000 person-years in the South African cohorts compared to 13.3 in the Swiss cohort, for a rate ratio of 2.11 (95% CI 1.10–4.06)..	[[174, 176]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7041	This comparative study of patients starting HAART in South Africa and Switzerland found that the initial virologic response was similar, despite profound differences in patient characteristics and the approach to antiretroviral therapy, and different viral strains causing the epidemics in the two countries.	[[44, 49]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7042	Mortality was higher in South Africa than in Switzerland, particularly during the first three months of HAART..	[[104, 109]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7043	All patients start a regimen consisting of a recommended NRTI backbone and either EFV or NVP.	[[82, 85], [57, 61]]	[]	['EFV', 'NRTI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7044	In December 2006, an estimated 1,000,000 people in South Africa needed HAART, and 325,000 were receiving it [5].	[[71, 76]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7045	In contrast, in Switzerland the prevalence of HIV-1 is below 1% and mainly of subtype B, HAART is covered by the compulsory basic health insurance package, and access is therefore universal.	[[89, 94]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7046	In both countries the provision of HAART has been found to be cost-effective from a health services and societal perspective [20–22]..	[[35, 40]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7047	For example, in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 39 (57%) of 68 patients who had relied on friends or relatives in Europe or the United States for antiretroviral drugs before a HAART programme was established had mutations in their virus associated with resistance to at least one drug [24].	[[168, 173]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7048	The use of single-dose NVP to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV may increase resistance levels, but the implications for treatment are a matter of debate and the subject of ongoing studies [31]..	[[23, 26]]	[]	['NVP']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7049	Nevertheless, a more standardised approach to the choice of the first-line regimen and monitoring of viral load could probably reduce costs in Switzerland without compromising the effectiveness of HAART..	[[197, 202]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7050	Patients in South Africa started therapy with much more pronounced immunodeficiency than did those in Switzerland, reflecting the large number of patients in great need of treatment during the scale-up of HAART in South Africa.	[[205, 210]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7051	A study from rural Uganda showed that a positive serum cryptococcal antigen was associated with substantially increased early mortality (adjusted relative risk 6.6; 95% CI 1.9–12.6) [34].	[[169, 171]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7052	The corresponding relative risk for active tuberculosis was 4.4 (95% CI 1.2–15.4) [34].	[[69, 71]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7053	Clinical trials in South Africa and elsewhere will help identify strategies to reduce mortality, including, for example, trials of HAART initiation in HIV–TB coinfected patients [35] and isoniazid preventive therapy in patients receiving HAART [36].

7054	After the first few months of HAART, mortality was low in both the South African and Swiss cohorts.	[[30, 35]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7055	South African national HAART programme still bases its treatment guidelines on the 2002 WHO guidelines, which recommend HAART only for patients with WHO stage IV disease or a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/μl [37].	[[23, 28], [120, 125]]	[]	['HAART', 'HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7056	Recent analyses from Cape Town showed high mortality before HAART is started or before a formal AIDS diagnosis is made [39–41].	[[60, 65]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7057	A recent analysis of the Swiss cohort showed that in Switzerland, late presentation is the reason for late initiation of HAART: once the diagnosis is made, uptake of HAART is fast [42]..	[[121, 126], [166, 171]]	[]	['HAART', 'HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7058	All patients in this study were treatment-naïve at the start of HAART, and results are therefore not affected by previous antiretroviral therapy..	[[64, 69]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7059	The two South African township programmes were part of the first public HAART programmes in Southern Africa and are typical of many sites involved in the scale-up of HAART in this region.	[[72, 77], [166, 171]]	[]	['HAART', 'HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7060	Our study did not, however, include the private sector in South Africa, and no comparison has been made between the overall quality of medical care to support HAART and HIV disease management that is likely to have an important impact on mortality.	[[159, 164]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7061	A public-health approach to HAART provision using a limited repertoire of drugs and relatively few viral load measurements resulted in virologic treatment outcomes in townships in South Africa that were similar to outcomes in Switzerland.	[[28, 33]]	[]	['HAART']	[]	PMC2443185.nxml
7062	Increasing maternal age was also associated with a longer duration of labor (0.49 h longer for a 5-y increase in age, 95% CI 0.46–0.51) and an increased risk of operative vaginal birth (adjusted odds ratio for a 5-y increase 1.49, 95% CI 1.48–1.50).

7104	The median AOO was between 16–19 y for alcohol for all countries except South Africa (20 y), and for tobacco in all countries except Nigeria (21 y) and China (20 y).	[[11, 14]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7105	The median AOO of illegal drug use was slightly older in all countries.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7106	For cannabis, median AOO was between 18–19 y, with the exception of Nigeria and Israel (both 22 y) and Lebanon (21 y).	[[21, 24]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7107	Cocaine use typically began at a slightly older age, with median AOO between 21–24 y for all countries where sufficient data were available to make an estimate..	[[65, 68]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7108	Note: Where lines are not presented for an individual country, either there was no assessment of the AOO of that drug, or fewer than 30 persons reported having used the drug (see Tables 2 and 5)..	[[101, 104]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7109	Equally remarkable as the consistent median AOO across countries is the age range of risk.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7110	The interquartile range (IQR) (i.e., 25th–75th percentiles) of AOO distributions were typically 15–21 y for tobacco, 16–22 y for cannabis, and 19–28 y for cocaine..	[[63, 66]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7111	The associations are remarkably consistent across countries and drug types, in that every one of the ORs is <1.0, indicating that risk at any given age is consistently higher in more recent cohorts than in older cohorts.	[[101, 103]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7112	The ORs have been normed to reflect relative-odds per 10 y of life.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7113	An OR of 0.8, for example, indicates that the odds of first use in any given year of life is, on average, only 80% as high among respondents who were age A at the time of interview compared to respondents who were age A − 10 y at interview..	[[3, 5]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7114	The easiest way to investigate the linearity assumption in Table 4 is to examine AOO distributions across cohort, so as to determine the extent to which between-cohort divergence can be seen consistently over the life course.	[[81, 84]]	[]	['AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7115	Such data are presented in Figure 2, where the AOO distributions of drug use are reconstructed based on retrospective AOO reports using the actuarial method pooled across countries..	[[47, 50], [118, 121]]	[]	['AOO', 'AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml

7117	Focusing first on the AOO curves for alcohol use, we can see a clear nonlinear association across cohorts, with respondents in the oldest cohort having a substantially lower AOO curve than respondents in the more recent cohorts.	[[22, 25], [174, 177]]	[]	['AOO', 'AOO']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7118	Evidence of women becoming more similar to men in more recent cohorts would be indicated by a sex-by-cohort interaction OR that was <1.0: this would mean that the relative-odds of use among women compared to men were lower in older cohorts than younger cohorts..	[[120, 122]]	[]	['OR']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7119	In the WMHS initiative, we compensated for survey nonresponse via poststratification adjustments, but this approach is limited if nonresponse is associated with drug use in other ways..	[[7, 11]]	[]	['WMHS']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7120	A considerable strength of the WMHS initiative is that the population survey research approach generally has been held constant.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['WMHS']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml
7121	We also do not have an “urbanicity” variable in most countries that could be considered comparable, so thus far in the WMHS papers we have not studied urbanicity in cross-national work..	[[119, 123]]	[]	['WMHS']	[]	PMC2443200.nxml

7127	Intermediate syndrome (IMS) is a major cause of death from respiratory failure following acute organophosphate poisoning.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7128	The objective of this study was to determine repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) predictors of IMS that would assist in patient management and clinical research..	[[94, 97], [75, 78]]	[[45, 73]]	['IMS', 'RNS']	['repetitive nerve stimulation']	PMC2459203.nxml
7129	All ten patients showed progressive RNS changes correlating with the severity of IMS.	[[36, 39]]	[]	['RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7130	As the patient developed clinical signs of IMS, decrement-increment was progressively noted at low and intermediate frequencies and a combination of decrement-increment and repetitive fade or severe decrement was noted at high frequencies.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7131	Thirty patients developed forme fruste IMS with less severe weakness not progressing to respiratory failure whose RNS was characterized by decrement-increment or a combination of decrement-increment and repetitive fade but never severe decrements..	[[39, 42], [114, 117]]	[]	['IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7132	Characteristic changes in RNS, preceding the development of IMS, help to identify a subgroup of patients at high risk of developing respiratory failure.	[[60, 63], [26, 29]]	[]	['IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7133	The forme fruste IMS with the characteristic early changes on RNS indicates that IMS is a spectrum disorder.	[[17, 20], [81, 84], [62, 65]]	[]	['IMS', 'IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7134	The intermediate syndrome (IMS), which results in muscle weakness in the limbs, neck, and throat, develops in some patients 24–96 hours after poisoning.	[[27, 30]]	[[4, 25]]	['IMS']	['intermediate syndrome']	PMC2459203.nxml
7135	Although IMS is a major contributor to the illness caused by organophosphate poisoning and can result in respiratory (breathing) failure and death, the functional changes that are associated with IMS (its pathophysiology) are poorly understood.	[[9, 12], [196, 199]]	[]	['IMS', 'IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7136	With a better understanding of these changes, it might be possible to find ways to prevent or treat IMS or to predict which patients with IMS are likely to develop respiratory failure.	[[100, 103], [138, 141]]	[]	['IMS', 'IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7137	In this study, the researchers make a set of measurements of nerve transmission in a large group of organophosphate-poisoned patients in Sri Lanka to discover more about the pathophysiology of IMS..	[[193, 196]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7138	In addition, nerve transmission was measured daily in the patients using an electrophysiological technique called repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS).	[[144, 147]]	[[114, 142]]	['RNS']	['repetitive nerve stimulation']	PMC2459203.nxml
7139	In the ten study participants who developed IMS, the researchers observed several characteristic changes in their muscle responses to RNS, some of which were seen before the clinical signs of IMS.	[[44, 47], [134, 137]]	[]	['IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7140	Other changes in muscle responses to RNS correlated with the development of clear IMS.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7141	Most importantly, in the four patients with IMS who developed respiratory failure, an RNS response pattern called severe decrement (a reduced response to the first electrical shock and then no response to the subsequent shocks) was seen before respiratory failure.	[[44, 47], [86, 89]]	[]	['IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7142	Finally, there were other characteristic changes in muscle responses to RNS in 30 patients with muscle weakness not severe enough for a diagnosis of IMS (incomplete or “forme fruste” IMS)..	[[149, 152], [183, 186], [72, 75]]	[]	['IMS', 'IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7143	These findings indicate that changes in nerve transmission that can be objectively monitored using RNS evolve during the development of IMS.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7144	In other words, IMS is a “spectrum” disorder in which the weakness and neuromuscular junction problems caused by organophosphate poisoning gradually progress over time through a series of electrophysiological changes that will sometimes resolve quickly and only in the most severe cases will result in respiratory failure.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7145	However, they suggest that the RNS tests might be useful in the clinical management of patients with organophosphate poisoning, particularly since such tests could provide an early warning of impending respiratory failure..	[[31, 34]]	[]	['RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7146	Organophosphate (OP) poisoning is a major global health problem [1,2] with hundreds of thousands of deaths every year [3,4].	[[17, 19]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7147	OP poisoning leads to three main syndromes: (1) acute cholinergic syndrome, (2) intermediate syndrome (IMS), and (3) OP-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDPN).	[[103, 106], [117, 119]]	[[80, 101]]	['IMS', 'OP']	['intermediate syndrome']	PMC2459203.nxml
7148	IMS remains a major contributor to the high morbidity and mortality in OP poisoning, an important and expensive medical problem in the under-resourced developing world [5]..	[[71, 73]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7149	More recent work suggest that IMS could occur before 24 h and even after 96 h [6–8].	[[30, 33]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7150	The pathophysiology of IMS is not clearly understood [8–15] but is generally believed to result from a persistent excess of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction [8,11,13,14,16–21]..	[[139, 142], [23, 26]]	[[124, 137]]	['ACh', 'IMS']	['acetylcholine']	PMC2459203.nxml
7151	Neuromuscular transmission has been recorded in OP poisoning in general and in patients with IMS using repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and single fiber electromyography [8,22–27].	[[93, 96], [48, 50], [133, 136]]	[[103, 131]]	['IMS', 'OP', 'RNS']	['repetitive nerve stimulation']	PMC2459203.nxml
7152	Neuromuscular transmission failure induced by OPs and other anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine) has been extensively studied in animals especially in rat models [23,28–32].	[[46, 48]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7153	However there are no previous studies to our knowledge that have evaluated patients with serial RNS from the onset of poisoning to describe sequential electrophysiological changes that correlate with clinical severity in IMS.	[[96, 99]]	[]	['RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7154	The objective of this study was to serially assess the neuromuscular junctional function with RNS in patients who are at risk of developing IMS to gather more information on the pathophysiology, and to determine any predictors of the syndrome that would be relevant clinically and in research..	[[140, 143], [94, 97]]	[]	['IMS', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7155	A prospective observational study of symptomatic OP poisoned patients was carried out in the Central Province of Sri Lanka with the approval of the Ethics Committees of the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka and the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.	[[49, 51]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7156	The inclusion criteria were admission within 24 h of ingestion of OP and signs of systemic intoxication.	[[66, 68]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7157	OP poisoning was confirmed by the history from the patient and/or relatives, containers brought to hospital, records in patient-transfer forms, characteristic smell in the breath, and clinical features typical of OP poisoning.	[[213, 215]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7158	Red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE) level was assessed in 59 of 78 patients using modified Elman method [34].	[[37, 45]]	[]	['RBC AChE']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7159	Accordingly, additional biochemical evidence of OP poisoning (serum OP level or RBC AChE level) was available in 69 of the 78 patients..	[[48, 50], [68, 70], [80, 88]]	[]	['OP', 'OP', 'RBC AChE']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7160	All the patients were assessed at least twice daily with a focused neurological examination to detect signs of IMS, and at least six times a day for cholinergic signs.	[[111, 114]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7161	A prospective definition for IMS was developed on the basis of Senanayake and Karalliedde's original description [5], namely significant muscle weakness in at least three of the following muscle groups (extraocular, neck flexor, proximal limb, and facial) observed at least 24 h after ingestion of OP.	[[29, 32]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7162	The OP ingested was chlorpyrifos in 59 of 78 patients.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml

7164	Blood samples were not available or were not assayed for OP levels in 11 patients.	[[57, 59]]	[]	['OP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7165	Depression of RBC AChE to <50% of the lower limit of the normal range and/or toxicologically significant concentrations of OP was detected in 69 of 78..	[[123, 125], [14, 22]]	[]	['OP', 'RBC AChE']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7166	One additional patient developed typical clinical features and characteristic electrophysiological features of IMS 15 h after the ingestion during the cholinergic crisis (increased secretions, pin point pupils, diarrhea, and generalized fasciculations) despite atropine therapy.	[[111, 114]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7167	Late onset (>24 h) respiratory failure requiring supported ventilation developed in five of the ten IMS patients.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7168	Marked weakness of neck flexion and proximal limb muscles (MRC grade 3 or less) was the most consistent feature in all ten patients.	[[59, 62]]	[]	['MRC']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7169	Of the ten IMS patients, two had both muscarinic features and fasciculations at the time of diagnosis of IMS.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7170	In five of ten IMS patients (50%) the initial electrophysiological changes were detected within the first 24 h of poisoning and in two patients within 24 and 48 h of poisoning.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7171	In this pattern, the maximum decrement was observed in the second compound muscle action potential (CMAP).	[[100, 104]]	[[66, 98]]	['CMAP']	['compound muscle action potential']	PMC2459203.nxml
7172	From the third CMAP there was progressive recovery of the amplitude until it attained the amplitude of the first CMAP typically by the fourth, fifth, or sixth (Figures 1B and 2A, 20–30 Hz).	[[15, 19], [113, 117]]	[]	['CMAP', 'CMAP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7173	Maximum decrement was seen at the second stimulus and thereafter the amplitudes of the subsequent CMAP increased but failed to attain the amplitude of the first CMAP even at the eight, ninth, or tenth (Figures 1C and 2B, 15–30 Hz) [24].

7174	As the muscular weakness progressed, the change occurred at intermediate frequencies and there was a corresponding decrement in the amplitude of the tenth CMAP, which was most marked with high frequency stimulations.	[[155, 159]]	[]	['CMAP']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml

7211	Typical RNS findings in the forme fruste group suggest that weakness of greater than MRC grade 3 in neck flexors and proximal limb muscles with or without weakness of muscles supplied by the motor cranial nerves is clinically useful as it reveals a much higher incidence of IMS than that is usually described.

7224	The electrophysiological findings in other common neuromuscular junction disorders suggest that, the electrophysiological findings of the IMS spectrum disorder are unlikely to represent a single simple pre- or postsynaptic defect.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['IMS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7225	The characteristic response to RNS at 2 to 3 Hz stimulation rate in myasthenia gravis is a progressive decrement in amplitude of the CMAP, which is most reliably found in weak muscles [42].	[[133, 137], [31, 34]]	[]	['CMAP', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml
7226	Low amplitude CMAPs are seen on motor nerve stimulation with marked facilitation of CMAP amplitude after brief muscle contraction or following high-frequency (20–50 Hz) RNS [43,44].	[[14, 18], [84, 88], [169, 172]]	[]	['CMAP', 'CMAP', 'RNS']	[]	PMC2459203.nxml

7230	However, the cause of weakness and RNS findings in this rare condition are not well understood but postulated to be explained by both presynaptic (e.g., decreased choline substrate for ACh production, negative feedback, damage to nerve terminal) and postsynaptic (e.g., end-plate damage or persistent partial depolarization, receptor desensitization) responses to persistently high levels of ACh [47]..

7311	With an estimated 180 million people who have diabetes, a figure expected to double by year 2030, it is clear that DM constitutes a substantial contributor to the current and future global burdens of TB.	[[115, 117]]	[]	['DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7312	For example, if we assume a RR of 3 and a prevalence of DM in Mexico of 6%, we can conclude that DM accounts for 67% of active TB cases among people with diabetes, and 11% of cases among the entire Mexican population (see Text S1 for the calculation) [44].

7313	The contribution of DM to the burden of TB may be even higher in countries such as India and China where the incidence TB is greater and mean age is lower.	[[20, 22], [40, 42], [119, 121]]	[]	['DM', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml

7315	The population-attributable risk for diabetes is comparable to that of HIV/AIDS; while HIV/AIDS is strong risk factor for TB (RRHIV = 6.5–26 [45], approximately 2–9 times greater than the RRDM estimated in this study), it is a less prevalent medical condition (33 million people infected in 2007 [46], approximately 5–6 times less prevalent than DM).

7316	Given these figures it may be puzzling to observe a decrease in TB in those areas that have experienced a growing burden of DM.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7317	We attribute this observation to negative confounding by factors such as improved nutrition and TB control measures in the areas of increasing DM such as India and China.	[[143, 145], [96, 98]]	[]	['DM', 'TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml

7322	Our analysis was based on estimates derived from observational studies that are vulnerable to confounding by variables associated with both DM and TB.	[[140, 142]]	[]	['DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7323	Studies that controlled for socioeconomic status in a multivariable model found that the adjusted effect of DM was reduced, but not eliminated.	[[108, 110]]	[]	['DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml

7325	Although we could not exclude the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured confounders in these observational studies, such as other chronic diseases that often coexist with diabetes, we found that the effect of DM on TB risk persisted even after adjustment for multiple potential confounders that are likely to be correlated with unmeasured factors..	[[221, 223], [227, 229]]	[]	['DM', 'TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7326	Since DM can lead to multiple health problems, the prevalence of DM is likely to be higher among persons attending clinics or being admitted to hospitals than it is in the general population.	[[6, 8], [65, 67]]	[]	['DM', 'DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7327	This bias would be expected to result in an underestimation of the effect of DM on TB, an expectation that was consistent with our finding that studies using hospital-based controls reported lower effect estimates [54].	[[77, 79], [83, 85]]	[]	['DM', 'TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7328	Other sources of potential bias include misclassification of either exposure or outcome, such as may have occurred in studies that did not employ laboratory tests to diagnose DM or TB.	[[175, 177]]	[]	['DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7329	When we restricted our analysis to studies that used glucose tests to determine DM status, we found that effect estimates were higher than in the studies that relied on less-rigorous methods, consistent with our expectation of a bias toward the null among studies that nondifferentially misclassify the exposure.

7333	Another important limitation of our systematic review is that most of the studies we included failed to examine age as an effect modifier of the relationship between DM and TB.	[[166, 168]]	[]	['DM']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7334	Because baseline glucose tolerance is lower in older persons without diabetes, elderly controls may have had an elevated risk of TB compared to younger ones [55], thus reducing the apparent effect of DM.	[[129, 131]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7335	[25] did not demonstrate this trend in the age-specificity of the effect of DM on TB and in fact showed a negative association among the elderly.	[[76, 78], [82, 84]]	[]	['DM', 'TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7336	The authors of the study note that results may have been biased by differential mortality in the elderly since individuals with diabetes who would have been most at risk for TB would have already died.	[[174, 176]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2459204.nxml
7337	Moreover, this study also differed from the others in that it relied on medical records rather than laboratory tests to determine DM status, and it had not included DM occurring in the last six of the 16 y during which TB case accrual occurred..

7376	More recently, the Center for Global Development convened a working group of leading economists from the IMF and World Bank, as well as public health experts, to assess the IMF's effect on the health sector (Does the IMF Constrain Health Spending in Poor Countries?) [5].	[[105, 108], [217, 220]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7377	The final report concluded that “in a number of ways IMF actions have unduly constrained countries' policy choices and that it needs to do more to help explore a broader range of policy options” (page 56, [5]).	[[53, 56]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7378	However, to our knowledge, these hypothesized effects of IMF programs on health and health infrastructure have yet to be tested with empirical data [5,16]..	[[57, 60]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7379	The post-communist Eastern European (EE) and former Soviet Union (FSU) countries provide a quasi-natural experimental setting for studying the relationship between IMF programs and infectious disease control.	[[37, 39], [66, 69], [164, 167]]	[]	['EE', 'FSU', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7380	Nearly every EE/FSU country during the early- to mid-1990s participated in an IMF program for the first time, and country participation in relatively similar IMF programs occurred in different periods, for different loan sizes, and for varying durations (table I in Text S1).	[[16, 19], [78, 81], [158, 161]]	[]	['FSU', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7381	We studied how these different IMF programs impacted upon differences in tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality trends among EE/FSU countries.	[[139, 142], [31, 34]]	[]	['FSU', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7382	Tuberculosis was the subject of interest because of the extensive longitudinal data available to study the disease in EE/FSU countries, and because tuberculosis incidence and prevalence is an indicator of societal health [19].	[[121, 124]]	[]	['FSU']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7383	Existing medical and public health literature has suggested a relationship between IMF programs and infectious disease outcomes, and the effect is hypothesized to be mediated via the health system, to which tuberculosis outcomes are sensitive [10].	[[83, 86]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7384	During the 1990s, EE/FSU countries experienced significant and increasing variations in their tuberculosis burdens: in the FSU, tuberculosis mortality rates doubled from 1991 to 2002 (from 6.2 to 13.3 per 100,000 population), while mortality in the EE started from a similar level but alternatively fell by roughly 40% (from 5.6 to 3.2 per 100,000 population) (see also table I and II in Text S1).	[[249, 251], [21, 24], [123, 126]]	[]	['EE', 'FSU', 'FSU']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7385	In parallel, among FSU countries the average outstanding IMF debt was $850 million for an average of 10.3 y in 1989–2005, compared to $270 million among EE countries for an average exposure time of 5.5 y.	[[153, 155], [19, 22], [57, 60]]	[]	['EE', 'FSU', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7386	The country with the greatest proportional tuberculosis mortality rate drop over this period, Slovenia, was the only one that did not partake in an IMF program.	[[148, 151]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7387	Today, tuberculosis rates in the FSU countries rank among the worst in the world, and the WHO notes that FSU is the only region lagging behind on Millennium Development Goal number 6 target to “halt and reverse” the spread of tuberculosis [1]..

7392	Tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DOTS population coverage levels and treatment success rates were obtained from the WHO Global Tuberculosis Database [20,21]; HIV and AIDS prevalence data were obtained from the WHO/UNAIDS Global HIV database [22].

7394	Selection bias may be an issue for assessing the effect of IMF programs on tuberculosis incidence and mortality rates.	[[59, 62]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7395	Participating in an IMF program may have been an act of financial desperation, reflecting “how sick the country was to begin with,” which could be linked to higher tuberculosis mortality rates irrespective of taking the IMF programs' “medicine.” We controlled for this “sick patient” possibility using a lag of the change in overall log gross domestic product (GDP) in our main models as well as other observed financial health measures in a series of robustness checks.	[[20, 23], [220, 223]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7396	Our controls for differences between countries also net out potential unobserved selection biases relating to country predispositions to undertake IMF programs.	[[147, 150]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7397	Lastly, we modeled the hazard of participating in an IMF program for each country, and used this constructed variable to explicitly control for potential unobserved selection bias (“Heckman-type” selection model or “control function” approach, see the discussion in Text S7) [32–34]..	[[53, 56]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7398	If IMF programs damaged public health capacity, they would be expected to lead to underreporting of tuberculosis outcomes, which would have reduced the likelihood of observing evidence to support this hypothesis.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7399	On the other hand, if IMF programs improved public health infrastructure, then they could have led to improved surveillance, revealed by increasing tuberculosis rates followed by eventual declines in tuberculosis rates.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7400	We tested the relationship between IMF programs and public health spending and resources in order to characterize the relationship between IMF programs and actual increases in tuberculosis rates, to determine whether detection biases may have occurred.	[[35, 38], [139, 142]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7401	We also used controls for DOTS treatment success and DOTS population coverage, measures of quality and quantity of tuberculosis treatment, to offset differences in tuberculosis infrastructure.	[[26, 30], [53, 57]]	[]	['DOTS', 'DOTS']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7402	Several variables were introduced as controls, to examine the independent association of IMF programs with tuberculosis outcomes.	[[89, 92]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7403	IMF is a dummy variable for whether a country was receiving IMF funding; GDP is logged per capita in constant USD for the year 2000; GDPc is the lag of GDP change; DEM is an index of democratization from the Freedom House democracy indicators database [36]; WAR is a dummy variable for whether a country experienced military or ethnic conflict; URBAN is the percentage of the country's population living in urban settings; EDUC is the percentage of the population that has received tertiary education; μ and η are sets of dummy variables that control for country and period effects, as described above.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7404	We subsequently add further variables to test the associations of the duration of exposure to IMF programs and the size of IMF loans with tuberculosis outcomes.	[[94, 97], [123, 126]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7405	We also performed Granger- and Sims-causality tests, which use the longitudinal nature of the data to test (i) whether IMF programs preceded and/or were contemporaneous with tuberculosis outcomes (“precedence”) and (ii) whether the future values added predictive value beyond these measures as a negative check on our findings (based on the principle that the future does not cause the past) (see Text S4 for more details) [37,38].	[[119, 122]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7406	Controls include either IMF or non-IMF program, change in log GDP, level of log GDP per capita, democratization index, dummy for occurrence of military or ethnic conflict, population dependency ratios, percentage of the population with tertiary education, and urbanization rates.	[[24, 27], [35, 38]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7407	Controls include either IMF or non-IMF program, change in log GDP, level of log GDP per capita, democratization index, dummy for occurrence of military or ethnic conflict, population dependency ratios, percentage of the population with tertiary education, and urbanization rates.	[[24, 27], [35, 38]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7408	Controls include either IMF or non-IMF program, change in log GDP, level of log GDP per capita, democratization index, dummy for occurrence of military or ethnic conflict, population dependency ratios, percentage of the population with tertiary education, and urbanization rates.	[[24, 27], [35, 38]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7409	Tuberculosis mortality rates rose by an average of 2.2 deaths per 100,000 from 1992 to 2002 in the post-communist countries; the absolute association of the IMF programs corresponds to 1.6 additional tuberculosis deaths per 100,000.	[[157, 160]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7410	Hence, participation in IMF programs appears to be connected with more than half of the increase in tuberculosis mortality rates observed in this cohort of countries.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7411	Associations of IMF Lending Programs with Log Tuberculosis Mortality Rates.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7412	Both WHO tuberculosis treatment indices—DOTS success rates and DOTS population coverage—had no significant associations with short-term tuberculosis mortality rates when accounting for the other explanatory variables, including IMF program lending.	[[40, 44], [63, 67], [228, 231], [5, 8]]	[]	['DOTS', 'DOTS', 'IMF', 'WHO']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7413	Adding HIV prevalence to the model did not significantly alter the coefficient describing the impact of IMF lending on tuberculosis mortality (model 2), although we did find evidence (similar to prior microlevel studies) that greater HIV prevalence was associated with tuberculosis mortality increases.	[[104, 107]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7414	Given the delay between rising HIV prevalence and associated increases in tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality [39], the finding that HIV prevalence did not impact upon the lending coefficient supports the hypothesis that IMF conditionalities worsened tuberculosis mortality rates by damaging infrastructure related to preventing mortality.	[[235, 238]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7415	We further tested the temporal patterns of the IMF's associations with tuberculosis mortality rates in Table 2 using a dynamic model specification that included both leads and lags of the dummy for IMF participation.	[[198, 201]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7416	If our results were possibly confounded by factors causing countries to take up IMF programs and increasing tuberculosis mortality rates (such as an ensuing financial crisis or other unobserved country “sickness”), then the periods prior to the start of an IMF program would likely have associations with increased tuberculosis rates.	[[80, 83], [257, 260]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7417	As shown in Table 2, we find that the periods prior to IMF program participation did not have a significant association with tuberculosis mortality rates (using a joint F-test, see Text S4 and [40] for details and additional specifications).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7418	On the other hand, once the IMF program is started, the negative associations endure for at least 4 y..	[[28, 31]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7419	Dynamic Association of IMF Lending Programs with Log Tuberculosis Mortality Rates.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7420	It may be the case that external debt is correlated with higher tuberculosis mortality, and that the observation associated with IMF programs is driven by reliance on donor monies and not specifically on the IMF programs.	[[129, 132], [208, 211]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7421	We test whether non-IMF lending, including credit from official and private sources and which did not involve the same set of economic conditionalities as the IMF programs, was associated with the relationships we observed with the IMF variables.	[[20, 23], [159, 162], [232, 235]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7422	As shown in Table 3, the regression revealed no evidence that the level of non-IMF lending had any association with tuberculosis mortality rates.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7423	However, we found that the dummy for non-IMF lending, shown in Figure 4, was significantly associated with reduced tuberculosis mortality (−7.6%, 95% confidence interval, −1.0% to −14.1%)..	[[41, 44]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7424	Associations of IMF Lending Programs with Log Tuberculosis Mortality Rates.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7425	Next, we evaluated different indicators of exposure to IMF programs to determine whether the total amount of IMF credit affected the observed outcomes.	[[55, 58], [109, 112]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7426	Larger debts may exert a stronger effect on tuberculosis mortality, because the IMF might have stricter standards on countries for making progress in implementing conditionalities for whom default would have greater consequences.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7427	The results of this study provided evidence for a dose-response relationship of increasing IMF loans: each 1% increase in IMF credit was associated with increased tuberculosis mortality rates by 0.9%..	[[91, 94], [122, 125]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7428	We also used a count variable for the number of years a country was exposed to IMF programs.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7429	We found that each extra year of exposure to an IMF program was associated with increased tuberculosis mortality by 4.1%..	[[48, 51]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7430	Lastly, to further confirm that causality runs from the IMF programs to worse mortality, and not vice versa (that is, to confirm that the IMF did not loan more funds as a result of observing whatever factors may have worsened tuberculosis mortality), we tested the effects of exiting from an IMF program.	[[56, 59], [138, 141], [292, 295]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7431	In the periods after a country leaves the IMF program, tuberculosis mortality rates drop by 31% on average, after correcting for economic changes, sociodemographic variables, and variations in tuberculosis infrastructure (see also tables I and II in Text S6).	[[42, 45]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7432	Similarly, although we identified a significant relationship between greater IMF lending and increased tuberculosis mortality rates, we found no relationship between the changes in IMF lending and the preceding period's change in tuberculosis mortality rates, meaning that IMF loans did not increase as a result of observing worsening tuberculosis mortality (tables I–III in Text S4 further describe the results of “Granger-causality” tests)..	[[77, 80], [181, 184], [273, 276]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7433	In all cases, the coefficients on the IMF programs were even larger (β = 0.29 in Figure 4), which emphasizes that our reported estimates are conservative..	[[38, 41]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7434	One explanation for the above results is that the associations of IMF programs with tuberculosis mortality rates may be driven by reductions in state capacity, which leads to drops in tuberculosis prevention and treatment capacity.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7435	By comparison, we test the associations of a non-IMF debt regime..	[[49, 52]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7436	Table 5 shows the results from a series of separate regression models using a variety of dependent variables that may mediate the observed relationship between IMF programs and tuberculosis mortality.	[[160, 163]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7437	IMF programs are linked to a significant 8% drop in government spending as a percentage of GDP, a 7% drop in the number of physicians per capita, and an average of 42% lower DOTS population coverage (Text S5 provides a preliminary path-analysis)..	[[174, 178]]	[]	['DOTS']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7438	Macro-Pathways of IMF Programs' Associations with Tuberculosis Outcomes.	[[18, 21]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7439	We also test whether IMF programs were associated with short-term increases in HIV prevalence.	[[21, 24]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7440	If the pathway linking IMF programs to increased tuberculosis mortality was through HIV prevalence, then we should find a direct relationship between IMF programs and increased HIV prevalence.	[[23, 26], [150, 153]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7441	Instead, we find no association between IMF programs and HIV prevalence; together with our previous results, this indicates that the association of IMF programs with tuberculosis mortality was mediated by other mechanisms..	[[40, 43], [148, 151]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7442	Among all countries, IMF debt has a more negative association than non-IMF debt in terms of these pathways (Table 5).	[[21, 24], [71, 74]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7443	We did not find any significant associations with non-IMF debt, although the coefficients for non-IMF debt were generally in the direction of improved tuberculosis control, suggesting that additional capital independent of IMF programs may have provided an important source of funding for strengthening health systems..	[[54, 57], [98, 101], [223, 226]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7444	We then tested the relationships of IMF and non-IMF debts with incarceration rates, which have been identified by numerous studies as important drivers of localized tuberculosis epidemics [40,41].	[[36, 39], [48, 51]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7445	Only non-IMF debt was linked to greater incarceration rates at p < 0.05, which suggests that incarceration may not have been one of the major pathways linking IMF programs to the adverse associations with tuberculosis outcomes..	[[9, 12], [159, 162]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7446	Despite the robustness tests used in this assessment, and strong evidence supporting the mechanism proposed to explain how IMF conditionalities affect tuberculosis mortality, there may still remain potential for our results to have been driven by some aspect of the changing environment that we have not controlled for.	[[123, 126]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7447	We can address the issue of unobserved selection bias directly by constructing, and conditioning upon, a variable of the hazard for entering into an IMF program, generated from a first step bivariate probit model (a “Heckman-type” selection model or “control function” approach, Table 6 and Text S7) [32–34].	[[149, 152]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7448	Once we add controls for potential selection bias associated with IMF lending, the negative association of IMF programs magnifies to 35% at p < 0.001.	[[66, 69], [107, 110]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7449	Stated otherwise, the factors that predisposed countries to take on IMF programs are linked to lower rates of tuberculosis mortality.	[[68, 71]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7450	This method of controlling for selection bias has an inherently counterfactual interpretation: the countries that started IMF programs, apart from the IMF programs themselves, would have experienced improved tuberculosis outcomes, net of our controls..	[[122, 125], [151, 154]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7451	Associations of IMF Programs with Log Tuberculosis Mortality Rates, Adjusted for Selection Bias.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7452	Our results show that IMF economic reform programs are strongly associated with rises in tuberculosis mortality rates in post-communist Eastern European and FSU countries, even after correcting for potential selection bias, tuberculosis surveillance infrastructure, levels of economic development, urbanization, and HIV/AIDS.	[[157, 160], [22, 25]]	[]	['FSU', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7453	We estimated an increase in tuberculosis mortality rates when countries participate in an IMF program, which was much greater than the reduction that would have been expected had the countries not participated in an IMF program.	[[90, 93], [216, 219]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7454	On the other hand, we estimated a decrease in tuberculosis mortality rates associated with exiting an IMF program.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7455	Both the duration and amount of IMF lending have an estimated dose-response relationship with tuberculosis mortality rates: each additional year of participation in an IMF program was associated with increases in tuberculosis mortality rates by 4.1%, and each 1% increase in IMF lending was associated with increases in tuberculosis mortality rates by 0.9%.	[[32, 35], [168, 171], [275, 278]]	[]	['IMF', 'IMF', 'IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7456	Debt to non-IMF lenders was found to have a slightly favorable association with tuberculosis mortality rates..	[[12, 15]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7457	The robust results observed help to account for puzzling differences in why countries such as Russia, which was exposed to the IMF's economic program for 13 y (corresponding to a ∼50% higher level in tuberculosis mortality rates) did so much worse than Slovenia, which did not undertake an IMF program.	[[290, 293]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7458	Similarly, Russia's level of DOTS coverage in 2003 was only 25%, whereas in Slovenia DOTS coverage had reached 100% already by 1996.	[[29, 33], [85, 89]]	[]	['DOTS', 'DOTS']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7459	Clearly, IMF programs are not the only explanation for variations in tuberculosis control, but these results offer a partial account of the ultimate correspondents of cross-country differences..	[[9, 12]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7460	First, as with all cross-country analysis, the potential exists for ecologic fallacies, though we have employed a number of well-accepted statistical tests for causal inference that strongly support the link between IMF policies and tuberculosis outcomes.	[[216, 219]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7461	The mechanism we hypothesize for the IMF's relationship to tuberculosis outcomes is plausible, given the numerous studies suggesting such a relationship between IMF conditionalities and infectious disease outcomes [6,7,9–18].	[[161, 164]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7462	If IMF programs did somehow lead to improved tuberculosis surveillance, net of controls, they might have lead to artifactual short-term increases in tuberculosis rates.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7463	Yet all of our evidence points to the contrary: IMF programs were linked to reduced government spending, less health resources per capita, and decreased tuberculosis treatment coverage.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7464	This suggests that IMF programs damaged health surveillance infrastructure, and any residual detection bias in our models rendered our conclusions conservative.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml
7465	It would be appropriate to further investigate the relationship between IMF policies and other diseases and their related infrastructure, as this analysis is restricted to tuberculosis outcomes and program variables.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['IMF']	[]	PMC2488179.nxml

7558	First, with the recent exception of USAID and DFID, bilateral agencies make little attempt to provide disease-specific, country-specific accounts.	[[46, 50], [36, 41]]	[]	['DFID', 'USAID']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7559	Malawi was reported to spend US$22.2 million p.a., a country five times smaller than Kenya, which reported only US$0.082 million government commitment, which in turn was half the value supposedly committed by its neighbour, Somalia (US$0.16 million), during a period when the central government in Somalia was not operational..	[[45, 49]]	[]	['p.a.']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7560	National governments, as partners in the RBM partnership, should be encouraged to and assisted in developing better metrics to enumerate annual financial flows to malaria control.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['RBM']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7561	Second, the GFATM and RBM do not currently have a working model or definition of the projected public health benefits resulting from financing different intervention mixes of known efficacy under different starting transmission conditions.	[[12, 17], [22, 25]]	[]	['GFATM', 'RBM']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7562	Hence, the GFATM uses overall populations at risk rather than transmission intensity, vector species, or other proximate determinants of infection risk as its guiding mantra for resource allocation [1,6].	[[11, 16]]	[]	['GFATM']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7563	Third, we have assumed that a standard mix of interventions would be required to meet the objectives of RBM that were laid out in the late 1990s..	[[104, 107]]	[]	['RBM']	[]	PMC2488181.nxml
7564	We believe that the uncertainty around priority setting based on risk, intervention selection, and the consequent planning of financial needs requires a clear approach by the GFATM, RBM, and their partners, informed by the baseline endemicity of malaria within the stable limits of P.

7566	The annual incidence (per 100,000 children) of rotavirus-positive admissions was 1,431 (95% CI 1,275–1,600) in infants and 478 (437–521) in under-5-y-olds, and highest proximal to the hospital.	[[92, 94]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7567	In this study, the researchers examine the incidence and clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections (specifically, group A rotavirus [GARV] infections; there are several different rotaviruses but GARV causes most human infections) among children admitted to the district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya..	[[202, 206]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7568	Nearly a third of the patients admitted with diarrhea who were tested had a GARV-specific protein in their stools (faeces); by contrast, only three in 100 children admitted without diarrhea showed any evidence of GARV infection.	[[76, 80], [213, 217]]	[]	['GARV', 'GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7569	Two-thirds of the GARV-positive children were infants (under 1 year old).	[[18, 22]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7570	Using these figures and health surveillance data (records of births, deaths, and causes of death) collected in the area around the hospital, the researchers calculated that the annual incidence (per 100,000 children) of GARV-positive hospital admissions in the region was 1,431 for infants and 478 for children under age 5 years.	[[220, 224]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7571	Children with GARV-positive diarrhea were less likely to have other illnesses (for example, malnutrition) than those admitted with GARV-negative diarrhea, the researchers report, but were more likely to have life-threatening complications such as severe dehydration and salt imbalances in their blood.	[[14, 18], [131, 135]]	[]	['GARV', 'GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7572	However, despite being more ill on admission, only 1 in 50 children with GARV-positive diarrhea died, compared to nearly 1 in 10 of the children with GARV-negative diarrhea; the GARV-positive children also left hospital quicker than those who were GARV-negative..

7575	Rotavirus is a major cause of severe diarrhoea worldwide causing in excess of 2 million hospitalisations per annum in under-5-y-old children [1], and group A rotavirus (GARV) is responsible for the vast majority of this disease [2].	[[169, 173]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7576	In terms of both morbidity and mortality, the greatest burden of GARV diarrhoea falls on young children living in less-developed countries [1,3], with Africa only second behind the Indian subcontinent in suffering the major disease impact [1].	[[65, 69]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7577	Evidence-based decisions regarding the wide-scale use of rotavirus vaccine intervention will benefit from accurate baseline estimates of the incidence and clinical characteristics of GARV in representative target populations [6,7]..	[[183, 187]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml

7633	The differential in mortality is primarily attributable to the high prevalence of severe malnutrition amongst the GARV-negative group compared to GARV-positives (37% versus 14%, p < 0.001, Table 3), and concomitant higher case fatality in the GARV-negative, compared to GARV-positive, malnourished children (21% versus 6%, p = 0.001).

7638	In our study, conducted in a rural district hospital in Kenya over a 3-y period, GARV was identified in 29% of children admitted with diarrhoea.	[[81, 85]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7639	We estimated the annual incidence (per 100,000 population) of GARV-associated hospitalisations with acute severe diarrhoea at 1,275–1,600 in children under 1 y of age, 437–521 in children under 5 y, and 187–223 in those under 13 y, similar figures to those reported in industrialised nations with greater access to health care and diagnostic facilities [1].	[[62, 66]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7640	Our data suggest that in the area served by our hospital, over 1% of infants are hospitalised with severe GARV-associated diarrhoea each year.	[[106, 110]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7641	By 5 y of age, over 2% of children will have been hospitalised with GARV diarrhoea (Table 1); by extrapolation, therefore, given the under-5-y population of Kenya (5.98 million in 2005 [25]), in the nation as a whole an effective rotavirus vaccine could prevent in excess of 28,000 hospital admissions in this age group every year.	[[68, 72]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7642	Our incidence estimates include only the children who present to hospital with diarrhoea; the under-ascertainment implicit in this method is reflected by the fact that the estimated incidence was over 70% higher for the population immediately served by KDH than for the DSS as a whole.	[[270, 273], [253, 256]]	[]	['DSS', 'KDH']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7643	Furthermore, there is no evidence that local knowledge of the high quality care at KDH influences admission rates.	[[83, 86]]	[]	['KDH']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7644	Only a small proportion (3%) of children without diarrhoea (controls) were found to be GARV positive.	[[87, 91]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml

7646	It is of interest that five of 19 positive controls in this study were less than 2 wk old, because subclinical infection and associated prolonged virus shedding, particularly within young infants, may play an important role in the spread of GARV infection.	[[241, 245]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7647	Consistent with previous studies [8] we found that the major burden (85%) of GARV diarrhoea fell on children under 18 mo of age, and over 60% of cases were in infants.	[[77, 81]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7648	From the clinical perspective, we found that relative to GARV-negative cases, the GARV-positive children with diarrhoea were more ill on admission, but their clinical signs and symptoms were mainly reflections of fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance and, therefore, readily corrected with the good supportive care available at this hospital.	[[57, 61], [82, 86]]	[]	['GARV', 'GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7649	The GARV-negative children admitted with diarrhoea were less acutely unwell at admission but had a higher incidence of coexisting illnesses, such as malnutrition, that were less readily treated and consequently had worse outcomes.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7650	Compared with early work in the US [32] we identify a similar clinical picture of higher prevalence of dehydration and vomiting, and short in-hospital stay, in rotavirus-infected relative to uninfected children, with similar age distribution of children with GARV infection but of lower prevalence.

7651	While we consider it unlikely that there was a substantial systematic bias in the distribution of severity characteristics (Table 3) attributable to the group of diarrhoea patients admitted who were not tested for GARV, or to patterns of admission related to distance, these are uncertainties that urge caution in the interpretation of the data..

7652	A limitation with the present study is the bias inevitable with hospital-based surveillance in estimating community incidence of GARV severe diarrhoea and associated mortality.	[[129, 133]]	[]	['GARV']	[]	PMC2488191.nxml
7653	Possible distortion of the distribution of severity in relation to distance, for example, resulting from children arriving from greater distances representing the more severe cases within their home areas, could lead to overestimation of GARV-positive diarrhoea severity relative to GARV-negative diarrhoea.

7662	For the cross-sectional analysis, we examined viral RNA from newly diagnosed ART-naïve persons in the US and Canada who had no detectable (wild type, n = 205) or one or more resistance-related mutations (n = 303) by conventional sequencing.

7665	However, the efficacy of ART (which itself selects for drug-resistant variants by giving them a growth advantage over drug-sensitive variants) is substantially reduced when these variants account for more than about 20% of the viruses in an infected person.

7666	In North America and Europe, where ART has been widely used for many years, around 20% of HIV-infected people who have taken ART themselves develop this level of drug-resistant virus, which can be transmitted by the same routes as nonresistant HIV (typically unprotected sexual intercourse or needle sharing).

7671	The findings of the cross-sectional study indicate that conventional bulk sequencing fails to detect a large proportion of transmitted HIV drug resistance and suggest that the transmission of drug-resistant variants from infectious ART-experienced people to ART-naïve individuals might not be uncommon.

7679	Second, we performed a retrospective case-control study on another group of participants to assess the impact of baseline minority treatment-relevant resistance mutations on the ability of ART to suppress virus replication.	[[189, 192], [190, 192]]	[]	['ART', 'RT']	[]	PMC2488194.nxml

7681	The populations for the cross-sectional study consisted of two groups of newly diagnosed HIV-1 subtype B-infected ART-naïve individuals (Figure 1; Table 1).	[[114, 117], [115, 117]]	[]	['ART', 'RT']	[]	PMC2488194.nxml
7682	The parent cohort consisted of 586 individuals examined in 2003–2005 who self-reported by questionnaire their clinical history and ART-naïve status [21].	[[131, 134], [132, 134]]	[]	['ART', 'RT']	[]	PMC2488194.nxml

7684	To evaluate whether minority variants with resistance mutations influence the virologic response to ART, we performed a retrospective case-control study using real-time PCR to test baseline pre-treatment samples from ART-naïve persons in the US who had participated in treatment studies with efavirenz/lamivudine (EFV/3TC) plus abacavir (ABC) or zidovudine (ZDV) (GlaxoSmithKline trials CNA 30021 and CNA 30024) during 2000–2003 (Figure 2; Table 1, case-control group) [22,23].

7686	Using this expected proportion, a minimum sample size (n = 209) was determined (nQuery Advisor, Statistical Solutions) so that a 95% confidence interval (CI) for minority resistance in the treatment successes would not cover zero (95% CI 0.001–0.039).

7714	The several cases of low-frequency drug resistance mutations that we identified is likely an underestimation of minority resistance prevalence, because only eight of the nearly 40 codons in PR and RT that are associated with drug resistance were evaluated [25].

7715	Clonal sequencing and resistance mutation linkage analysis (see Figure S1 and Text S2) have shown that multiple minority drug resistance mutations can be present and that these mutations may coexist unlinked from majority mutations in ART-naïve persons..

7716	The presence of unlinked mutations in multidrug-resistant ART-naïve persons might reflect mutations that were once linked in oligoclonal populations and then independently reverted as a result of mutation (fitness) modulations or immune selection [15,26,27].

7873	In the apparently protected animals, there was no evidence of infection whereas in animal E81, a naïve challenged control, proviral loads of 26, 5, 130, 2,100, and 105 proviral DNA copies/105 MNC equivalents were detected in each tissue respectively..	[[192, 195]]	[]	['MNC']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7874	To determine if mucosal exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection had stimulated T cell immunity, SIV-specific IFN-γ ELISpot analysis was performed on PBMC from protected animals and one infected animal (E81) taken 20 wk after challenge.	[[121, 126], [108, 111], [161, 165]]	[]	['IFN-γ', 'SIV', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7875	Four of seven protected animals had IFN-γ-secreting Gag-specific T cells at frequencies ranging from 144 to 261 SFU/106 cells, whereas the infected animal E81 had both Gag and Tat-specific circulating T cells (Figure 3A).	[[36, 41]]	[]	['IFN-γ']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7876	Interestingly, the presence of Gag-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells in animal D68 (pre-exposed to placebo gel) confirmed that challenge virus gained access to antigen presenting cells.	[[44, 49]]	[]	['IFN-γ']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7877	Interpretation of T cell reactivity in MNC from colorectal tissue was precluded by a very high spontaneous background; however, MNC from the small intestine of three of four protected animals contained SIV-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells with broader antigen specificity (including specificity for nonstructural virus-encoded antigens) and in two of these cases no responses in PBMC (Figure 3B).

7878	Thus the local mucosal immune system may have been primed by SIV antigens produced de novo during drug-modulated abortive or limited infection.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml

7883	The lowest concentration of plasma tenofovir associated with protection as defined by failure to isolate and/or detect virus in PBMC and plasma and lack of seroconversion, was 119.9 ng/ml (Table 5).	[[128, 132]]	[]	['PBMC']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7884	Using tissues from another group of SIV-naïve macaques (group F), first, we demonstrated that SIVmac251/32H replicated in this system and that replication was sensitive to addition of tenofovir in vitro (Figure 4A).	[[36, 39]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7885	Next, we investigated the replication kinetics in intestinal tissue explants taken from another four SIV naïve macaques that were given tenofovir gel in vivo 3 h prior to necropsy (group G).	[[101, 104]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml

7887	Mean percent inhibition of SIV Gag p27 production plus standard deviations are shown..	[[27, 30]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7888	The preclinical study reported here using the SIV-macaque challenge model, showing a statistically significant protective effect, strongly supports the notion that local application of an ARV agent can efficiently protect against subsequent intrarectal challenge with virus.	[[188, 191], [46, 49]]	[]	['ARV', 'SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7889	Topical use of tenofovir prior to virus exposure also facilitated the priming of SIV-specific T cell responses in a proportion of macaques, opening up the possibility that this type of prophylaxis may be able to prime and/or boost immune responses elicited with experimental vaccines..	[[81, 84]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7890	Although this may have partial benefit, in the longer term, as shown in the SIV model, virus frequently escapes from immune control following the selection of variants mutated in T cell epitopes [35,36].	[[76, 79]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7891	The concept of using ARVs topically to prevent infection with HIV is gaining momentum and several clinical trials are currently in progress [37].	[[21, 24]]	[]	['ARV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7892	The findings reported here showing protection from overt infection in six of nine macaques against rectal transmission of SIV after topical application of tenofovir gel, suggest that this approach has high potential for clinical translation.	[[122, 125]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7893	Although it is not possible to rule out that these effects were due to natural animal-to-animal variability, the VI profiles were highly atypical compared to those observed in our previous studies with this stock of virus [17,18].	[[113, 115]]	[]	['VI']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7894	If indeed the rate limiting step to 100% protective efficacy is local uptake of tenofovir, several possibilities require further investigation, including: is efficacy increased (a) at higher concentrations of administered tenofovir gel; (b) with larger volumes of administered gel; (c) with optimised gel formulations; (d) with combinations of ARTs having differing pharmacokinetics; (e) with prior washing to remove residual faecal matter? Thus, the quantification of plasma tenofovir following rectal administration could be used to inform the optimisation of rectal dosing in terms of concentration, volume, formulation, and timing to accelerate the progression of this approach to clinical trials..	[[345, 347]]	[]	['RT']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7895	Rectal administration of tenofovir gel may be less likely to select for RT escape mutants even when inadvertently used by HIV-infected individuals; however, this possibility requires further investigations to determine the cumulative concentration of drug entering the circulation.	[[72, 74]]	[]	['RT']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7896	Even though, following optimisation, rectal use of tenofovir alone may prove to be sufficient to confer protection, use in combination with other topical ARVs/microbicides may be advantageous.	[[154, 157]]	[]	['ARV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7897	Furthermore, we have recently shown that drug combinations can protect colorectal explants against infection with rarely transmitted RT escape mutants (C.	[[133, 135]]	[]	['RT']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7898	At the doses used in the present study it is predicted that the protective effects will be confined to the rectal portal of entry; however, the high degree of protection against rectal challenge seen in the present study, including the absence of SIV detection by highly sensitive qPCR in regional lymph nodes was perhaps surprising given that virus may translocate rapidly in dendritic cells [38].	[[247, 250]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7899	Indeed, targeting an SIV vaccine preparation to the vicinity of these nodes has conferred significant protection from rectal challenge [39]..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7900	Thus, topical application of ARVs such as tenofovir following local viral challenge could be used to further investigate early virus trafficking in vivo, an area of study in which there is still a critical paucity of information..	[[29, 32]]	[]	['ARV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7901	The priming of SIV-specific T cells detectable in the circulation in the absence of seroconversion is reminiscent of similar responses seen in so-called highly exposed, persistently seronegative individuals (reviewed in [42]).	[[15, 18]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7902	Indeed, transient early postexposure treatment of SIV-infected macaques with tenofovir has been associated with the stimulation of T cell responses, sometimes in the absence of SIV-specific serum binding antibodies [44].	[[50, 53], [177, 180]]	[]	['SIV', 'SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7903	Indeed in the large intestine, spontaneous IFN-γ production was so high as to exclude analysis for antigen-specific cells, and although considerably lower in cells recovered from the small intestine, more work using cells recovered from SIV-naïve macaques is required to define a robust cut-off level for specific responses.	[[43, 48], [237, 240]]	[]	['IFN-γ', 'SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7904	We have reported previously that single low dose exposure to SIV by the rectal route can induce T and B cell priming in the absence of overt infection and a serum antibody response [25].	[[61, 64]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7905	Firstly, the ARV-gel was delivered controllably under idealised conditions.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['ARV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7906	For some users application of a rectal gel may be acceptable, for others, formulation of the ARV into a suppository may be more acceptable.	[[93, 96]]	[]	['ARV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7907	Compatibility with other products that may be used before AI is a further consideration.	[[58, 60]]	[]	['AI']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7908	Fourthly, the predictive value of the SIV-macaque model requires further investigation.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7909	However, in the case of the recombinant replication deficient adenovirus vaccine (STEP trial), reduction in virus load was originally demonstrated following immunization with a construct expressing SIV Gag and challenge with simian HIV (SHIV)-89.6P [46].	[[198, 201]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7910	Although an enhanced effect was shown in a further study using adenovirus constructs expressing SIV Gag, Rev, Tat, and Nef, this approach was tested only in the more sensitive Mamu-A*01 macaques [49].	[[96, 99]]	[]	['SIV']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml
7911	Moreover, given the functional IFN-γ T cell responses induced, there may be potential for synergy between topical ARV/microbicide use and vaccination as a two-pronged strategy for preventing infection with HIV..	[[31, 36]]	[]	['IFN-γ']	[]	PMC2494562.nxml

7919	A prognostic model that combined age, motor score, and pupillary reactivity had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between 0.66 and 0.84 at cross-validation.

7926	Given the resources required to treat TBI, a very useful research tool would be the ability to accurately predict on admission to hospital what the outcome of a given injury might be.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['TBI']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml
7927	The study presented here is one of a number of analyses done by the IMPACT research group over the past several years using a large database that includes data from eight randomized controlled trials and three observational studies conducted between 1984 and 1997.	[[72, 74], [68, 74]]	[]	['CT', 'IMPACT']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml
7928	They found that the strongest predictors of outcome were age, motor score, pupillary reactivity, and characteristics on the CT scan, including the presence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.	[[124, 126]]	[]	['CT']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml

7937	Establishing a reliable prognosis early after injury is notoriously difficult, as is captured in the Hippocratic aphorism, “No head injury is too severe to despair of, nor too trivial to ignore.” Following the development of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [1] and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) [2], it was found that confident predictions could be made after 24 h following the injury, but were difficult to establish on admission [3].

7938	Furthermore, prognostic models have an important role in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), for stratification [4] and statistical analyses that explicitly consider prognostic information, such as covariate adjustment [5,6]..	[[88, 90], [87, 90]]	[[57, 84]]	['CT', 'RCT']	['randomized controlled trial']	PMC2494563.nxml

7942	In parallel with this work and as part of a collaboration between CRASH and IMPACT investigators, we developed and describe here a basic model that includes easily accessible clinical features, and additional models that included findings from computed tomography (CT) scanning, and laboratory measurements..

8005	Our model predictions may be better than the CRASH predictions for high-income countries, because of the more detailed information in the models and larger patient numbers used in model development.	[[45, 50]]	[]	['CRASH']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml
8006	Predictions may, even on average, be too poor, considering that treatment standards have improved over time, including trauma organization, diagnostic facilities such as CT scanning, and critical care management.	[[170, 172]]	[]	['CT']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml
8007	We did not, however, find a clear trend of better outcomes in more recently treated patients when we applied identical selection criteria to the studies in the IMPACT database.	[[164, 166], [160, 166]]	[]	['CT', 'IMPACT']	[]	PMC2494563.nxml

8070	We therefore hypothesized that ROS generation caused by the N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine may trigger activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway..	[[31, 34]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml

8075	Pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitors SKF-525A or cimetidine, drugs that have been shown to potently block N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine, completely blocked cocaine-induced ROS formation (Figure 6E), confirming that N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine is involved in ROS formation in AF5 cells.	[[188, 191], [280, 283]]	[]	['ROS', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8076	Further, ROS generation appears to be the source of cocaine-induced ER stress, as both SKF-525A and cimetidine also completely inhibited cocaine-induced ATF4 up-regulation and cyclin A down-regulation (Figure 6F and 6G)..	[[68, 70], [9, 12]]	[]	['ER', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml

8078	To determine whether P450 inhibitors can block cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition in neural progenitor cells in the developing neocortex, pregnant rats at the early period of neurogenesis (E13–E15) were pretreated with 100 mg/kg cimetidine IP 1 h before each cocaine administration.

8081	To determine whether the protection afforded by cimetidine was due to the recovery of cocaine-induced down-regulation of cyclin A and mediation by ER stress, the effects of cimetidine on expression of ATF4 and cyclin A were also measured in prefrontal cortex of cocaine-treated fetuses.

8089	Moreover, the fact that the ROS-induced ER stress consequently promoted transcriptional down-regulation of cyclin A is further evidence that reductions in cyclin A signaling are responsible for decreased proliferation.	[[40, 42], [28, 31]]	[]	['ER', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8090	Although we do not know the mechanism underlying the proliferative effect of cocaine on astrocytes, it is worth noting that cellular stress inhibits proliferation in CNS progenitors, whereas it activates proliferation in astrocytes, leading to gliosis in the brain [42].	[[166, 169]]	[]	['CNS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml

8093	Upon ER stress such as ER oxidation, the ER sensor protein PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, subsequently promoting translational activation of ATF4 [35,36].	[[5, 7], [23, 25], [41, 43]]	[]	['ER', 'ER', 'ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8094	Thus, ER oxidation is capable of causing cell cycle arrest via the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway..	[[6, 8]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8095	In addition to promoting dopamine auto-oxidation, cocaine can itself get through the cell membrane in its nonprotonated form, where it produces ROS via N-oxidative metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P450 at the ER [37].	[[211, 213], [144, 147]]	[]	['ER', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8096	Redox cycling between norcocaine nitroxide and N-hydroxynorcocaine is responsible for generation of ROS such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide [37,44].	[[100, 103]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8097	Indeed, we found that cocaine induces endogenous ROS accumulation as early as 15 min after treatment of AF5 cells (Figure 6D).	[[49, 52]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8098	Further, the P450 inhibitors SKF-525A and cimetidine, which have been shown to inhibit N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine, blocked cocaine-induced endogenous ROS generation, translational activation of ATF4, down-regulation of cyclin A, and proliferation inhibition in AF5 cells (Figure 6E–6H).	[[157, 160]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8099	In contrast, lipophilic free radical scavengers and the iron chelator DFO did not block cocaine-induced inhibition of proliferation, suggesting that lipid peroxidation and iron-mediated ROS production (Fenton reaction) in mitochondria are not primarily involved in cocaine-induced ROS production in AF5 cells.	[[186, 189], [281, 284]]	[]	['ROS', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8100	We therefore conclude that cocaine biotransformation by microsomal cytochrome P450 is the source of cocaine-induced ROS generation, which promotes cell cycle arrest via ER stress-induced cyclin A down-regulation (Figure 6E–6H)..	[[169, 171], [116, 119]]	[]	['ER', 'ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8101	One of the cellular adaptive responses to oxidative ER stress is inhibition of translation, which may explain the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in cocaine-treated fibroblasts.	[[52, 54]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8102	We demonstrated here that oxidative ER stress-mediated down-regulation of cyclin A contributes to cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the developing neocortex (Figure 8).	[[36, 38]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8103	As shown in Figure 4C, the concentrations of cocaine in the developing neocortex following the second IP administrations of 20 mg/kg cocaine peaked higher than 30 μM within 30 min.	[[102, 104]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8104	Thus, exposure to 30 μM cocaine for 30 min is sufficient to increase endogenous ROS to a degree that activates the ATF4 signaling pathway.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8105	Moreover, in addition to ROS induced by N-oxidation of cocaine, auto-oxidation of monoamines could contribute to ATF4-mediated cyclin A down-regulation in fetal brains.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['ROS']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8106	Nevertheless, our data demonstrated that cytochrome P450-dependent N-oxidation of cocaine promotes cyclin A2 down-regulation by causing ER stress, which constitutes at least one mechanism underlying cocaine-induced inhibition of ventricular progenitor cell proliferation in the developing neocortex..	[[136, 138]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8107	We have shown that pretreatment with the P450 inhibitor cimetidine effectively abolished both the cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the VZ of the developing rat brain, and cyclin A down-regulation (Figures 7A, 7D, S7A, and S7D).	[[172, 174]]	[]	['VZ']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml
8108	This effect of cimetidine appeared to be mediated by prevention of N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine and consequent ER stress, as cimetidine also prevented the cocaine-induced increase in ATF4 (Figures 7C and S7C).	[[116, 118]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC2504032.nxml

8243	The well-established premature infant pain profile (PIPP), for example, ascribes a value to infant behaviours such as sleep state and change in facial expression to produce a composite pain score, which is weighted for age.

8266	Addition of the physiological score to the facial expression score does not improve the correlation (regression coefficient [excluding weighting factors] = 0.77, 95% CI 0.45–1.09, p < 0.0001; correlation coefficient = 0.699).	[[166, 168]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2504041.nxml

8268	Loss-of-function variants in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) are major determinants of eczema.	[[58, 61]]	[[47, 56]]	['FLG']	['filaggrin']	PMC2504043.nxml

8272	In Manchester (n = 503) an independent and significant association of the development of eczema by age 12 mo with FLG genotype was confirmed (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13–3.36, p = 0.02).	[[155, 157], [114, 117], [142, 144]]	[]	['CI', 'FLG', 'HR']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8273	In addition, the risk increased because of the interaction of cat ownership at birth and FLG genotype (HR 3.82, 95% CI 1.35–10.81, p = 0.01), with no significant effect of the interaction with dog ownership (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16–2.20, p = 0.43).

8275	Our data suggest that cat but not dog ownership substantially increases the risk of eczema within the first year of life in children with FLG loss-of-function variants, but not amongst those without.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8276	In two independent cohorts of children, Hans Bisgaard and colleagues show an association between mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) and ownership of cats, but not dogs, with development of eczema..	[[130, 133]]	[[114, 123]]	['FLG']	['filaggrin']	PMC2504043.nxml
8277	Recently, researchers discovered that two common “loss-of-function” variants in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) predispose people to eczema.	[[109, 112]]	[[98, 107]]	['FLG']	['filaggrin']	PMC2504043.nxml
8278	The researchers determined which FLG variants each child had inherited and classified those with either one or two defective copies of FLG as having an FLG mutation.	[[33, 36], [135, 138], [152, 155]]	[]	['FLG', 'FLG', 'FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml

8280	For children without FLG mutations, cat ownership at birth had no effect on eczema risk but for children with FLG mutations, cat ownership at birth (but not dog ownership) further increased the risk of developing eczema..	[[21, 24], [110, 113]]	[]	['FLG', 'FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml

8286	Since most eczema in individuals with FLG mutations occurs within the first year of life, the important environment exposures that may affect the penetrance of FLG mutations are likely to occur in the first months of life.	[[38, 41], [160, 163]]	[]	['FLG', 'FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8287	We therefore investigated whether there is an interaction between FLG loss-of-function mutations with early-life environmental exposures (pets and dust mites) in relation to the development of eczema.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml

8309	Multiple Cox regression that included FLG genotype, cat, dog, and mite allergen levels, and the interaction between genotype and allergen levels confirmed an increased risk of developing eczema due to mutation (HR 2.22 [1.27–3.89], p = 0.005) and the interaction between cat allergen and FLG genotype (with risk increasing risk with increasing allergen level among children with FLG mutation; HR for interaction 1.31 [1.03–1.67], p = 0.026).

8310	Nonsignificant trends were observed for dog allergen exposure (HR 1.07 [1.00–1.15], p = 0.06), the direction of which appeared to inverse in the interaction with FLG mutation (0.84 [0.68–1.05, p = 0.1])..	[[162, 165], [63, 65]]	[]	['FLG', 'HR']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8311	Allergic sensitisation was uncommon in early life in both cohorts (in COPSAC, cat sensitisation was detected in one infant with FLG mutation at 6 mo but none at 18 mo; in MAAS, two children were skin test positive to mite, four to cat, and three to dog at age 1 y).	[[70, 76], [128, 131], [171, 175]]	[]	['COPSAC', 'FLG', 'MAAS']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8312	We have demonstrated a significant interaction between FLG loss-of-function main mutations (501x and 2282del4) and cat ownership at birth on the development of early-life eczema in two independent birth cohorts.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8313	Our data suggest that cat but not dog ownership substantially increases the risk of eczema within the first year of life in children with FLG loss-of-function variants, but not amongst those without.	[[138, 141]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8314	The rationale for this is that in both cohorts the increased risk of eczema amongst FLG mutation carriers occurred only in the first year of life and not thereafter (Figures 1 and 2).	[[84, 87]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8315	This also means that the important environmental exposures that may interact with FLG in the development of eczema must occur in the first months of life.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8316	We hypothesized that weakening of physical barrier of skin in FLG deficient individuals may potentiate the effect of relevant environmental exposures.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8317	Therefore we investigated whether there is an interaction between FLG loss-of-function mutations with a range of environmental exposures for which the skin could be the relevant route of exposure.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8318	Since FLG is not expressed in either lungs or GI tract, we did not test exposures through such routes.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8319	In addition, in COPSAC we explored the possibility of testing the effect of skin colonization with S.	[[16, 22]]	[]	['COPSAC']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8320	Clinical outcomes were not identical, resulting in a higher prevalence of infant eczema in MAAS (parentally reported, 37%) compared to COPSAC (investigator-diagnosed, 28%).	[[135, 141], [91, 95]]	[]	['COPSAC', 'MAAS']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8321	This suggests that MAAS was capturing milder cases and overreporting of eczema by parents.	[[19, 23]]	[]	['MAAS']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8322	We acknowledge the fact that the initial finding is based on only five children with eczema with a cat at home and carrying FLG mutation in COPSAC, but the power of the statistics (p < 0.0001) derives from the longitudinal dataset with the time of onset clearly distinguishing these populations.	[[140, 146], [124, 127]]	[]	['COPSAC', 'FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8323	Furthermore, it is worth noting that the findings were confirmed in the analysis of allergen levels, that pet ownership did not differ between those with and without the variant, and that the interaction between FLG variants and cat ownership was replicated in an independent cohort that included a larger number of cat exposed FLG mutation carriers..	[[212, 215], [328, 331]]	[]	['FLG', 'FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8324	Dust samples were taken from the child's mattress in COPSAC and from the lounge floor in MAAS, which resulted in different distribution of results (10-fold increase from third to fourth quartile in COPSAC with only 3-fold difference in MAAS, indicating that quartile analysis would not be appropriate in MAAS).

8325	In the original discovery in COPSAC of the loss-of-function variants 501x and 2282del4 in the gene encoding filaggrin, we demonstrated a strong association to the development of eczema in the first years of life.	[[29, 35]]	[]	['COPSAC']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8326	This is in keeping with previous studies showing that the effect of FLG loss-of-function mutations was equally strong on allergic and nonallergic eczema, demonstrating that the development of eczema is not dependent on allergic sensitisation [2].	[[68, 71]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8327	It may be possible that cat exposure mediates its effect in the FLG mutated genotypes via altered bacterial exposure, or that cat exposure may be a surrogate marker for other unknown environmental influences penetrating the imperfect skin barrier because of defective profilaggrin synthesis..	[[64, 67]]	[]	['FLG']	[]	PMC2504043.nxml
8328	Our findings of a consistent effect from early-life cat ownership on the phenotypic expression of eczema in infants with FLG loss-of-function mutations in two independent birth cohorts is an example of gene–environment interaction in a common complex disease, demonstrating that such gene–environment interactions exist and are detectable given appropriately detailed studies of environmental exposures..

8337	In a controlled trial among patients attending three publicly funded STD clinics (one in each of three US cities) from December 2003 to August 2005, all patients (n = 38,635) were systematically assigned to either a theory-based 23-min video depicting couples overcoming barriers to safer sexual behaviors, or the standard waiting room environment.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8338	An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare STD incidence between intervention and control patients.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml

8340	During 14.8 mo (average) of follow-up, 2,042 patients (5.3%) were diagnosed with incident STD (4.9%, intervention condition; 5.7%, control condition).	[[90, 93]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8341	In survival analysis, patients assigned to the intervention condition had significantly fewer STDs compared with the control condition (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99)..	[[94, 97]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml

8344	In the US alone there are 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) every year.	[[81, 84]]	[[50, 78]]	['STD']	['sexually transmitted disease']	PMC2504047.nxml
8345	Some STDs are caused by bacteria (for example, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis).	[[5, 8]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml

8347	While symptoms are generally more common in men than women, many STDs cause no symptoms.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8348	Untreated STDs are more serious for women and may include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pain.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8349	Bacterial and parasitic STDs can be cured with various drugs; STDs caused by viruses cannot be cured although they can be treated with antiviral drugs..	[[24, 27], [62, 65]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8350	Although these interventions reduce the incidence of STDs, they usually involve several sessions of individual or group counseling and are likely too complex and expensive to implement in busy STD clinics.	[[53, 56], [193, 196]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8351	In this study, the researchers ask whether a short video that contains key STD prevention messages can reduce the acquisition of new infections among patients who watch the video while sitting in the waiting room of an STD clinic (a “teachable moment” when people are likely to be receptive to messages about health risks)..	[[75, 78], [219, 222]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8352	The researchers showed this video (and displayed related posters) in the waiting rooms of three US publicly funded STD clinics every alternate month over a 20-month period.	[[115, 118]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8353	Another 20,000 “control” patients who attended the clinics in the months when the video was not shown were exposed to a standard waiting room environment in which only leaflets about STDs and condoms were available.	[[183, 186]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8354	The researchers then reviewed medical records and STD surveillance registries to find out how many patients in each group developed laboratory-confirmed STD after their initial clinic visit.	[[50, 53], [153, 156]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8355	Their statistical analyses show that the intervention reduced the number of new STD diagnoses by nearly 10%.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8356	The intervention was most effective among patients who had had an STD at their first visit and among men, but did not appear to reduce the chances of women acquiring an STD..	[[66, 69], [169, 172]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8357	These findings suggest that showing a brief, carefully designed video in STD clinic waiting rooms might be a simple, effective way to reduce the incidence of STDs.	[[73, 76], [158, 161]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8358	More research is needed to discover which parts of the video—those that increase knowledge and perception of STD risk, those that promote positive attitudes toward condom use, or those that provide the necessary skills to negotiate safe sexual practices—are the most effective and why the video appeared to be more effective for some groups of patients than others.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8359	The intervention also needs to be tested in other types of clinics but if it works as well elsewhere as in the three study clinics, the widespread implementation of this low-cost, low-intensity waiting room intervention could produce a meaningful reduction in the incidence of STDs in the US and elsewhere..

8362	Video interventions offer a pragmatic mechanism for delivering STD prevention messages because of their relative low cost and ease of implementation, likely acceptability, and high likelihood of being adopted and sustained if found effective.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8363	In previous studies of STD clinic patients, brief video-based interventions, typically combined with individual or small-group counseling, have been associated with reductions in risky sexual behavior [7,8] and new infections [9,10].	[[23, 26]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8364	We conducted a controlled multisite trial to evaluate whether a brief video, which contained STD prevention messages targeted to all patients in the waiting room, was effective in reducing acquisition of new infections after that clinic visit..	[[93, 96]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8365	The trial was conducted at three public STD clinics, one each in Denver (Colorado), in Long Beach (California), and San Francisco (California) from December 2003 through August 2005.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8366	Routinely collected data were abstracted electronically (Denver and San Francisco) or manually (Long Beach) from clinic medical records for dates of the index visit (i.e., first visit during the study period) as well as dates of all subsequent clinic visits, reason for index visit, date of birth, sex, race/ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation, and STD diagnoses at both initial and subsequent visits.

[[31, 34]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8371	For the latter, incident infections for reportable STDs in California and Colorado (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV) were matched to patient clinic records based on first and last names and dates of birth, and/or SOUNDEX code algorithms.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8372	For these STDs, an incident infection was defined as any laboratory-confirmed infection diagnosed after the index visit.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8373	Each clinic followed standard local protocols for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of STDs as well as partner notification that were consistent with existing national guidelines..	[[87, 90]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8374	In designing the study, we assumed 5% per year cumulative incidence of these STDs in the absence of intervention, and thus estimated that a sample size of approximately 45,000 patient record abstractions would be required to detect a 10% reduction in annual STD incidence with 80% power at the 10% significance level when based on a comparison of two binomial proportions.	[[77, 80], [258, 261]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8375	Following an intent-to-treat approach, we used the Kaplan-Meier survival method with the Greenwood variance estimator to compute cumulative STD incidence and to compare incidence between conditions as a function of time from the index clinic visit [16].

8382	Multiple STDs were diagnosed for some patients.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8383	Most patients diagnosed with an STD (77%) received diagnoses in the STD clinics as opposed to other facilities, as reported through disease registries; the proportions of patients receiving clinic diagnoses were similar between conditions (77.3% for intervention versus 76.5% for control; Fisher exact test, p = 0.67)..

8392	Compared with the standard waiting room experience, the Safe in the City video intervention significantly reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections among patients attending these STD clinics.	[[194, 197]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8393	Given the large number of patients visiting public STD clinics annually, the approximately 10% effect size observed in this study could result in clinically meaningful reductions in new infections if applied to clinics with similar populations where the intervention is similarly effective.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8394	[10] found that brief video-based interventions, typically conducted with group or individual counseling, can reduce infections among specific groups of STD clinic patients.	[[153, 156]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8395	Extending that research, our findings demonstrate that a video-alone intervention without such counseling can also reduce infections among entire STD clinic populations.	[[146, 149]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8396	among African American and Hispanic male patients attending New York City STD clinics [9] also included a video-alone arm.	[[74, 77]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8397	Our findings suggest that patients in these STD clinic populations generally paid attention to the video despite competition for their attention in the waiting room (e.g., encounters with clinic and administrative staff, cell phone conversations, availability of reading materials).	[[44, 47]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8398	Using the waiting room as an opportunity to provide prevention interventions may maximize the “teachable moment” [17] during which patients, already cognizant of their elevated STD risk, may be most amenable and receptive to intervention..	[[177, 180]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8399	Among females, however, we found no evidence of a significant beneficial (or harmful) intervention effect, which may reflect a true lack of video effectiveness, the limitations of using passive follow-up to ascertain incident STD outcomes (given the asymptomatic nature of many infections in women), and generally lower STD incidence and a smaller number of patients among females.	[[226, 229], [320, 323]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8400	Given that the apparent lack of effect observed in women is consistent with other studies [7,10], additional research is needed on the effectiveness of brief interventions among at-risk females who visit STD clinics and whether such interventions may be better targeted toward males.	[[204, 207]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8401	Clinicians also were not blinded to condition assignment, which could introduce bias if provider knowledge of study condition affected decisions on which patients received STD screening during the observation period.	[[172, 175]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8402	The fact that the proportion of patients in each condition who were infected with STD was perfectly balanced at the index visit (when condition assignment was most likely to be known to providers) suggests that the likelihood of such bias during follow-up was small..

8403	These findings are also limited by the use of passive follow-up to ascertain incident STD outcomes, rather than active laboratory screening.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8404	The record-based approach used to identify new infections is efficient for studies in which large numbers of observations require follow-up; however, this approach cannot capture undetected asymptomatic infections or account for patient migration, and, as a result, may underestimate STD incidence.	[[284, 287]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8405	Nevertheless, despite the large sample size required for studying this low-intensity intervention, we were able to use laboratory-confirmed STD outcomes, as opposed to only behavioral or social psychological measures, to measure intervention impact, the importance of which has been well described [6,18,19].	[[140, 143]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8406	The intervention also did not appear to alter care- or treatment-seeking behavior of patients assigned to the video intervention, as the same proportion of patients in both study arms returned to the STD clinic during the study period, irrespective of whether they were diagnosed with incident STD; this suggests minimal bias in our study design.	[[200, 203], [294, 297]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8407	Only one public STD clinic was located in each city, and return visits were documented for similar proportions of patients in each condition.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8408	Although we lacked information for individual records on factors such as whether partner notification and treatment services were accessed, the fact that patients in both study conditions encountered the same basic clinic services in alternating months—and were remarkably similar to each other—suggests that these issues cannot explain the finding of reduced STD risk associated with intervention exposure.	[[360, 363]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8409	These factors, taken together, suggest that the observed reduction in STD incidence was both real and likely to be an underestimate of the true effect..	[[70, 73]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8410	Compared with previous studies of behavioral interventions in STD clinics, this evaluation was conducted under actual clinic conditions rather than controlled study conditions.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8411	By incorporating our intervention into the natural waiting room environment, we directly observed the effectiveness of Safe in the City in reducing new infections among large populations of STD clinic patients.	[[190, 193]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8412	Because our evaluation included all clinic patients, our finding of reduced STD incidence is likely generalizable to patients at these clinics and likely to STD clinics with similar patient profiles.	[[76, 79], [157, 160]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8413	Further suggesting the generalizability of our findings, we note that several identified predictors of infection were the same as those reported in other studies of STD clinic populations (e.g., men who have sex with men, young age, and infection at the index clinic visit) [10,20–23]..	[[165, 168]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8414	In summary, we found that showing a brief informational and skills-building video intervention in STD clinic waiting rooms, without a counseling component, decreased new STDs among high-risk patients in three urban clinics.	[[98, 101], [170, 173]]	[]	['STD', 'STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8415	As has been shown with video-based health interventions (e.g., tobacco cessation and proper antibiotic use) in other settings [27–29], these interventions have the potential to reach large numbers of STD clinic patients efficiently and to be acceptable to clinic staff because they are easy to implement and inexpensive.	[[200, 203]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8416	Given that STD clinics account for only a minority of diagnosed infections [30], future research should evaluate the appropriateness, applicability, and effectiveness of video interventions in other settings serving at-risk populations, including family planning clinics, adolescent clinics, jails and detention centers, urgent care settings, and private clinic settings.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['STD']	[]	PMC2504047.nxml
8417	Additional research could also focus on identifying the particular element(s) of video-based interventions (e.g., prevention messages regarding condom use, partner treatment, and/or partner communication, stimulation of patient communication with providers) that facilitate reductions in new infections among STD clinic populations, as was observed in this and other studies [9,10].

8419	Here, we identified a novel pathway of renal protection from ischemia using ischemic preconditioning (IP)..	[[102, 104]]	[[76, 100]]	['IP']	['ischemic preconditioning']	PMC2504049.nxml
8420	For this purpose, we utilized a recently developed model of renal ischemia and IP via a hanging weight system that allows repeated and atraumatic occlusion of the renal artery in mice, followed by measurements of specific parameters or renal functions.	[[79, 81]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8421	Studies in gene-targeted mice for each individual adenosine receptor (AR) confirmed renal protection by IP in A1−/−, A2A−/−, or A3AR−/− mice.	[[70, 72], [104, 106]]	[[50, 68]]	['AR', 'IP']	['adenosine receptor']	PMC2504049.nxml
8422	In accordance, the A2BAR-antagonist PSB1115 blocked renal protection by IP, while treatment with the selective A2BAR-agonist BAY 60–6583 dramatically improved renal function and histology following ischemia alone.	[[22, 24], [114, 116], [72, 74]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8423	Using an A2BAR-reporter model, we found exclusive expression of A2BARs within the reno-vasculature.	[[12, 14], [67, 69]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8424	Studies using A2BAR bone-marrow chimera conferred kidney protection selectively to renal A2BARs..	[[17, 19], [92, 94]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8425	These results identify the A2BAR as a novel therapeutic target for providing potent protection from renal ischemia..	[[30, 32]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8426	If the nephrons stop working for any reason, the rate at which the blood is filtered (the glomerular filtration rate or GFR) decreases and dangerous amounts of waste products such as creatinine build up in the blood.	[[120, 123]]	[[90, 116]]	['GFR']	['glomerular filtration rate']	PMC2504049.nxml
8427	There are four different adenosine receptor—A1AR, A2AAR, A2BAR, and A3AR—and in this study, the researchers use ischemic preconditioning as an experimental strategy to investigate which of these receptors protects the kidneys from ischemia in mice, information that might provide clues about how to protect the kidneys from ischemia..	[[53, 55], [60, 62]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8428	Twenty-four hours later, they assessed the renal function of the mice by measuring their blood creatinine levels, GFRs, and urine production.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['GFR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8429	These results suggest that A2BAR may help to protect the kidneys from ischemia.	[[30, 32]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8430	However, wild-type mice (but not A2BAR−/− mice) treated with an A2BAR agonist (which activates the receptor) retained their kidney function after renal ischemia without ischemic preconditioning.	[[67, 69]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8431	Finally, the researchers report that A2BAR has to be present on the blood vessels in the kidney to prevent ischemia-induced acute renal failure..	[[40, 42]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8432	Importantly, these findings suggest that A2BAR might be a therapeutic target for the prevention of renal ischemia.	[[44, 46]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8433	However, results obtained in animals do not always reflect the situation in people, so before A2BAR agonists can be used to reduce the chances of patients developing acute renal failure after surgery, these results need confirming in people and the safety of A2BAR agonists need to be thoroughly investigated..	[[97, 99], [262, 264]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8434	Acute renal failure is defined as a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), occurring over a period of minutes to days [1].	[[86, 89]]	[[58, 84]]	['GFR']	['glomerular filtration rate']	PMC2504049.nxml
8435	Once released into the extracellular space, adenosine can activate four individual G-protein coupled receptors (A1AR, A2AAR, A2BAR, and A3AR).	[[121, 123], [128, 130]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8436	At present, it remains unclear which ARs mediate renal protection from ischemia.	[[37, 39]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8437	Some studies suggest a role of signaling through myeloid A2AAR in renal protection [29], other studies found signaling through the A1AR in inhibiting renal inflammation and necrosis [30]..	[[60, 62]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8438	Similarly to studies of renal protection by IP, previous studies in the heart have shown a critical role of extracellular adenosine generation in IP-dependent cardioprotection.	[[44, 46], [146, 148]]	[]	['IP', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8439	For example, gene-targeted mice for cd39 [27] or cd73 [28] are not protected by cardiac IP-treatment.	[[88, 90]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8440	Moreover, a recent study compared myocardial infarct sizes in gene-targeted mice for each individual adenosine receptor (AR) and found a pivotal role of the A2BAR in attenuating ischemia-induced myocardial cell death [28].	[[121, 123], [160, 162]]	[[101, 119]]	['AR', 'AR']	['adenosine receptor']	PMC2504049.nxml
8441	In addition to its tissue-protective effects, extracellular adenosine signaling has been implicated in several cardio-specific functions including A1AR-dependent changes in cardiac conduction and heart rhythm (e.g., changes in P-R interval, atrio-ventricular blockade) [31], release of natriuretic peptide by cardiac myocytes [32], or the regulation of coronary blood flow by A2A or A2BARs [11].	[[386, 388]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8442	While adaptation of cardiac myocytes trigged by adenosine, bradykinin, and opioids—leading to activation of protein kinase C (PKC)—is central to cardiac IP [35,36], ischemic injury of the kidneys is characterized by vascular and renal-tubular injury [37,38], suggesting that preconditioning phenomena of the kidneys represent a form of vascular or reno-tubular adaptation.	[[153, 155], [127, 129]]	[]	['IP', 'KC']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8443	Therefore, previous studies of adenosine in IP-dependent cardioprotection have focused on histological assessment of myocardial cell death or leakage of myocardial specific enzymes into the systemic circulation [27,28,39], while studies of extracellular adenosine in reno-protection by IP require assessment of specific renal functions (e.g., glomerular filtration, tubular absorption, or secretion).	[[44, 46], [286, 288]]	[]	['IP', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8444	Therefore, we recently developed a murine model of in situ IP and ischemia of the kidneys using a hanging weight system that allows repeated and atraumatic occlusion of the renal artery in mice, followed by measurements of specific parameters or renal function (e.g., GFR, creatinine clearance, urine production) to study molecular pathways of innate renal protection from ischemia [40]..

8576	On the basis of these studies showing reno-vascular expression of the A2BAR and other studies showing myeloid A2BAR expression, particularly on macrophages [44], we studied the contribution of renal or hematopoietic A2BAR signaling to renal protection during ischemia or IP.

8577	For this purpose, we generated A2BAR bone marrow chimeric mice.	[[34, 36]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8578	As expected, A2BAR+/+ → A2BAR+/+ chimeric mice showed a similar degree of renal protection (attenuated plasma creatinine and improved GFR) following IP treatment as WT mice (Figure 10A and 10B).	[[134, 137], [149, 151], [165, 167]]	[]	['GFR', 'IP', 'WT']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8579	Moreover, renal protection by IP was abrogated in A2BAR−/− → A2BAR−/− mice, similar to A2BAR−/− mice (Figure 10A and 10B).	[[30, 32]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8580	Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous studies showing myeloid A2BAR signaling in vascular inflammation [44], renal protection by IP was conferred solely to renal A2BAR.	[[69, 71], [133, 135]]	[]	['AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8581	In fact, A2BAR−/− → A2BAR+/+ chimeric mice showed a similar degree of renal protection by IP as A2BAR+/+ mice (Figure 10A and 10B).	[[90, 92]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8582	In contrast, renal resistance to ischemia was not increased by IP treatment of A2BAR+/+ → A2BAR−/− chimeric mice.	[[63, 65]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8583	Taken together, these studies suggest a critical role of renal A2BARs (as opposed to hematopoietic) in mediating the protective effects of IP..	[[66, 68], [139, 141]]	[]	['AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml

8591	To further define the contribution of renal or hematopoietic A2BARs to renal protection from ischemia, we next performed studies of renal ischemia in A2BAR bone-marrow chimeric mice pretreated with the selective A2BAR agonist BAY 60–6853.	[[64, 66], [153, 155], [215, 217]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8592	Bone marrow chimeric A2BAR mice expressing the A2BAR on the tissues but not on their hematopoietic cells (A2BAR−/− → A2BAR+/+ mice) showed dramatic improvement in renal function with BAY 60–6583 pretreatment (60 μg/kg) as assessed by plasma creatinine, GFR, and renal histology—similar to A2BAR+/+ mice (Figure 10C–10E).	[[24, 26], [50, 52], [253, 256]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'GFR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8593	In contrast, BAY 60–6583 pretreatment of A2BAR bone marrow chimeric mice with the A2BAR expressed exclusively on hematopoietic cells (A2BAR+/+ → A2BAR−/− mice) lacked any measurable improvement of renal function during ischemia (Figure 10C–10E).	[[44, 46], [85, 87]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8594	Together with our studies in A2BAR reporter mice showing exclusive expression of the renal A2BAR within the vasculature, these data suggest that signaling through the reno-vascular A2BAR is a critical control point for attenuating acute renal failure from ischemia..	[[32, 34], [94, 96], [184, 186]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8595	On the basis of previous studies showing a critical role of myeloid A2AAR signaling in attenuating renal ischemia reperfusion injury [29] and the above results, we pursued the hypothesis that myeloid A2AAR signaling attenuates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, while renal A2BAR signaling is important for preconditioning phenomena.	[[71, 73], [203, 205], [277, 279]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8596	Consistent with the above hypothesis, these studies revealed that reno-protection by IP required renal A2BAR signaling, while mice without a myeloid A2AAR had more severe ischemia reperfusion injury (Figure 11A and 11B)..

8600	Statistics: One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test was performed (**, p < 0.001 versus the respective group with IP; *, p < 0.001 versus A2AWT→A2BKO).	[[115, 117], [148, 150]]	[]	['IP', 'KO']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8601	For this purpose, we utilized a recently developed model of renal IP via isolated renal artery occlusion by use of a hanging weight system, which allows for highly reproducible renal injury [40].	[[66, 68]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8602	While previous studies on IP in the heart have focused on histological measurements of myocardial cell death or leakage of myocardial specific enzymes into the systemic circulation, this model allowed us to assess the consequences of IP-treatment on the preservation of specific renal functions, such as GFR, urinary sodium or potassium excretion, or urine production.	[[304, 307], [26, 28], [234, 236]]	[]	['GFR', 'IP', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8603	On the basis of previous work showing extracellular adenosine generation in renal protection from ischemia [19,20], we tested the contribution of signaling through individual ARs to renal protection from ischemia by IP.	[[175, 177]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8604	In fact, selective A2BAR agonist treatment provided a similar degree of renal protection from ischemia as IP treatment itself, suggesting that A2BAR agonists “precondition” the kidneys.	[[22, 24], [146, 148], [106, 108]]	[]	['AR', 'AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8605	Finally, the use of a reporter mouse model and studies in bone marrow A2BAR chimera helped to pinpoint the source of A2BAR protection to the reno-vasculature.	[[73, 75], [120, 122]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8606	In contrast, the present studies have revealed a critical contribution of the reno-vascular A2BAR to renal IP protection.	[[95, 97], [107, 109]]	[]	['AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8607	Taken together, these data provide what we believe to be a previously not appreciated role of reno-vascular A2BAR signaling in enhancing renal resistance to ischemia and provide strong rationale for therapeutically targeting the A2BAR during renal ischemia..	[[111, 113], [232, 234]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8608	Presently, the molecular mechanism of how renal A2BAR signaling attenuates renal injury from ischemia remains unknown.	[[51, 53]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8609	As previous studies have shown an important role of erythropoietin in tissue adaptation to hypoxia [58] or preconditioning [59], it would be tempting to speculate that extracellular adenosine generation and signaling (e.g., through the A2BAR) could influence renal erythropoietin secretion, e.g., as part of an autocrine feedback loop.	[[239, 241]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8610	These studies revealed that targeting extracellular adenosine generation (cd3−/− mice) [60,61] or individual ARs (AR−/− mice) [61] did not influence stimulated erythropoietin release.	[[109, 111]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8611	On the other hand, a study on extracellular adenosine in hypoxic preconditioning uncovered a novel molecular pathway of how adenosine signaling through the A2BAR can promote tissue adaptation to limited oxygen availability [26].	[[159, 161]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8612	Guided by recent studies demonstrating bacterial inhibition of NFκB through cullin-1 (Cul-1) deneddylation, they found a dose-dependent deneddylation of Cul-1 mediated by signaling through the A2BAR, suggesting that extracellular accumulation of adenosine and signaling through the A2BAR suppresses NFκB activity via deneddylation of Cul-1.	[[196, 198], [285, 287]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8613	These results are consistent with our present study showing that A2BAR-dependent signaling pathways are important for the anti-inflammatory properties of renal IP..	[[68, 70], [160, 162]]	[]	['AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8614	However, renal A2BAR signaling could also involve other (and also faster) mechanisms of renal protection other than modulating inflammation.	[[18, 20]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8615	Moreover, the studies of bone-marrow chimeric A2BAR mice also tended to support inflammation as an effect rather than a cause as the receptors responsible for the protection were found not to be on the marrow-derived cells but on the reno-vasculature.	[[49, 51]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8616	As such, considerable evidence now indicates that IP-protection in the heart may be the result of preservation of the cardiac mitochondria by preventing permeability transition pore formation, which normally occurs in the first minutes of reperfusion [36,57,62].	[[50, 52]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8617	Moreover, the fact that abolished renal protection with A2BAR antagonist treatment and reno-protective effects with A2BAR agonist treatment are limited to a time window that ends during early reperfusion (Figures 6 and 7) speaks in favor for such mechanisms..	[[59, 61], [119, 121]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8618	The present study is consistent with previous work showing an anti-inflammatory role of vascular A2BAR signaling.	[[100, 102]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml

8620	The authors found highest expressional levels of the A2BAR in the vasculature and on macrophages.	[[56, 58]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8621	In addition, genetic deletion of the A2BAR was associated with low-grade vascular inflammation, augmentation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, and a consequent down-regulation of IκBα in addition to up-regulation of adhesion molecules of the vasculature.	[[40, 42], [147, 152]]	[]	['AR', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8622	Consistent with the present study on renal protection by IP, vascular inflammation was significantly increased in mice gene-targeted for the A2BAR [44].	[[144, 146], [57, 59]]	[]	['AR', 'IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8623	However, and in contrast to the present studies showing a critical role of the reno-vascular A2BAR in providing renal protection from ischemia, Yang et al.	[[96, 98]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8624	found that bone marrow (and to a lesser extent vascular) A2BARs regulated the low grade inflammation observed in their studies [44]..	[[60, 62]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8625	The present study on A2BAR signaling during renal ischemia is consistent with recent work on cardiac generation and signaling of adenosine [63,64].	[[24, 26]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8626	For example, two recent studies provided genetic evidence for extracellular adenosine generation in cardio-protection by IP [27,28].	[[121, 123]]	[]	['IP']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8627	Consistent with the present studies and other studies on myocardial pre- or postconditioning [63,64], the authors found a pivotal role of the A2BAR, revealing that A2BAR agonist treatment preconditions the myocardium.	[[145, 147], [167, 169]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8628	Other investigations of renal ischemia and reperfusion injury have found contributions of the A2AAR [29,51,65].	[[97, 99]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8629	As such, a series of studies of renal ischemia and reperfusion in chimeric mice found that bone marrow-derived cells play an important role in A2AAR-mediated tissue protection [29,65,66].	[[146, 148]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8630	Taken together with results from the present studies, these findings suggest a combined role of myeloid A2AARs—predominantly expressed on T-lymphocytes—and reno-vascular A2BARs in attenuation of renal ischemia..	[[107, 109], [173, 175]]	[]	['AR', 'AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8631	In conclusion, the present studies revealed induction and signaling through the reno-vascular A2BAR as part of an endogenous pathway to increase renal resistance to ischemia and attenuate ischemia reperfusion injury.	[[97, 99]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8632	Extensions of these findings provide evidence for targeting the A2BAR therapeutically during renal ischemia.	[[67, 69]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml
8633	In addition, it will be important to address pharmacokinetics and additional effects of A2BAR agonist treatment on coagulation, blood pressure, or pulmonary function, before such studies can be implemented and tested in a clinical setting..	[[91, 93]]	[]	['AR']	[]	PMC2504049.nxml

8637	It has not been investigated whether differences in drug effect between adults and children might occur in the treatment of drug-resistant partial epilepsy, although such differences may have a substantial impact on the design and results of paediatric randomised controlled trials (RCTs)..

8638	Three electronic databases were searched for RCTs investigating any antiepileptic drug (AED) in the add-on treatment of drug-resistant partial epilepsy in both children and adults.	[[88, 91], [45, 48]]	[[68, 86]]	['AED', 'RCT']	['antiepileptic drug']	PMC2504483.nxml
8639	The treatment effect was compared between the two age groups using the ratio of the relative risk (RR) of the 50% responder rate between active AEDs treatment and placebo groups, as well as meta-regression.	[[144, 147], [99, 101]]	[[84, 97]]	['AED', 'RR']	['relative risk']	PMC2504483.nxml
8640	Five AEDs were evaluated in both adults and children with drug-resistant partial epilepsy in 32 RCTs.	[[5, 8], [96, 99]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8641	The treatment effect was significantly lower in children than in adults (RR ratio: 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.89]; p = 0.02 by meta-regression).	[[114, 116], [73, 75]]	[[93, 112]]	['CI', 'RR']	['confidence interval']	PMC2504483.nxml
8642	The relative risk of the total withdrawal rate was also significantly lower in children than in adults (RR ratio: 0.65 [95% CI 0.43–0.98], p = 0.004 by metaregression), due to higher withdrawal rate for seizure aggravation in children (5.6%) than in adults (0.7%) receiving placebo (p < 0.001).

8643	Children with drug-resistant partial epilepsy receiving placebo in double-blind RCTs demonstrated significantly greater 50% responder rate than adults, probably reflecting increased placebo and regression to the mean effects.	[[80, 83]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8644	Whenever an adult is given a drug to treat a specific condition, that drug will have been tested in “randomized controlled trials” (RCTs).	[[132, 135]]	[[101, 128]]	['RCT']	['randomized controlled trial']	PMC2504483.nxml
8645	In RCTs, a drug's effects are compared to those of another drug for the same condition (or to a placebo, dummy drug) by giving groups of adult patients the different treatments and measuring how well each drug deals with the condition and whether it has any other effects on the patients' health.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8646	However, for pediatric trials to yield useful results, the general differences in the treatment response between children and adults must first be determined and then allowed for in the design of pediatric RCTs.	[[206, 209]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8647	In this study, the researchers investigate whether there is any evidence in published RCTs for age-dependent differences in the response to antiepileptic drugs in drug-resistant partial epilepsy..	[[86, 89]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8648	The researchers searched the literature for reports of RCTs on the effects of antiepileptic drugs in the add-on treatment of drug-resistant partial epilepsy in children and in adults—that is, trials that compared the effects of giving an additional antiepileptic drug with those of giving a placebo by asking what fraction of patients given each treatment had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period compared to a baseline period (the “50% responder rate”).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8649	This “systematic review” yielded 32 RCTs, including five pediatric RCTs.	[[36, 39], [67, 70]]	[]	['RCT', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8650	These findings, although limited by the small number of pediatric trials done so far, suggest that children with drug-resistant partial epilepsy respond more strongly in RCTs to placebo than adults.	[[170, 173]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8651	Epilepsy is a common disorder in children that often requires antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment for many years [1].	[[82, 85]]	[[62, 80]]	['AED']	['antiepileptic drug']	PMC2504483.nxml
8652	However, most AEDs have inadequate paediatric use information [2].	[[14, 17]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8653	Indeed, AEDs are evaluated primarily in adult patients [3], and only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed in paediatric population [1].	[[8, 11], [105, 108]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8654	Overall, the typical practice has been to extend the use of AEDs approved for adult epilepsy to children [5]..	[[60, 63]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8655	For instance, the clearance of modern AEDs was found to be 20% to 170% higher in children than in adults [7].	[[38, 41]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8656	Trial design could be affected as well—reluctance to recruit children with epilepsy into AEDs trials [8] might result in the selection of more severe epilepsy in paediatric than in adult RCTs.	[[89, 92], [187, 190]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8657	Specifically, a greater placebo effect in children than in adults would narrow the expected effect size of AED treatment in the former population, and it could lead to falsely negative RCT outcomes if the sample size is directly extrapolated from data collected in adult studies.	[[107, 110], [185, 188]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8658	To test this issue we performed a meta-analysis that compared AED efficacy in paediatric and adult RCTs..	[[62, 65], [99, 102]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8659	Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from 1960 to 30 June 2007, for RCTs investigating any AED in the add-on treatment of drug-resistant partial epilepsy.	[[139, 142], [116, 119]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml

8662	Furthermore, in RCTs in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, for ethical reasons AEDs are usually not compared to placebo but to another active treatment, whereas the nine RCTs performed in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy included a mixed population of children and adults without providing detailed results by age groups [13–21]..

8663	Drug-resistant partial epilepsy is defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE; http://www.ilae.org/) as an epileptic disorder characterised by: (i) seizures whose initial signs and symptoms indicate, or are consistent with, initial involvement of only part of one hemisphere [22] and (ii) persistent seizures during a minimum of 2 y despite treatment with trials of at least two different AEDs used at the therapeutic level [23–26].	[[405, 408]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8664	However, the inclusion criteria used in RCTs are more stringent and usually require that the patient had failed three or more AEDs, while the actual average number of failed AEDs reported in those trials is often eight or more [23]..

8669	To evaluate efficacy of AEDs, we performed a meta-analysis that compared the 50% responder rate in active AEDs treatment group with the one observed in placebo group, and used the logarithm of relative risk method.	[[24, 27], [106, 109]]	[]	['AED', 'AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml

8685	By contrast, in TPM trials, children had a median seizure frequency twice that of adults (21 and 10.5 per month, respectively).	[[16, 19]]	[]	['TPM']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8686	However, it should be stressed that 40% of the children included in the LTG paediatric trial were diagnosed as suffering from idiopathic epilepsy.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['LTG']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8687	This form of epilepsy was not reported in other trials, and is often considered an exclusion criterion in RCTs performed in adult patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy..	[[106, 109]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8688	Indirect comparison of the RR of the 50% responder rate in adults and children showed lower values in children (1.91 [95% CI 1.54–2.37]) than in adults (2.90 [2.47–3.41]), with confidence intervals that did not overlap (Figures 2 and 3A).

[[256, 259]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8693	The 1.9 times greater 50% responder rate observed in children receiving placebo as compared to adult was a consistent finding across all AEDs, including LTG (1.7 for OXC and GBP, 1.8 for TPM, 1.9 for LEV, and 2.0 for LTG)..	[[137, 140], [174, 177], [200, 203], [153, 156], [217, 220], [166, 169], [187, 190]]	[]	['AED', 'GBP', 'LEV', 'LTG', 'LTG', 'OXC', 'TPM']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml

8696	Overall, the seizure-free rate in the modified ITT population was available for four AEDs (GBP, LEV, OXC, and TPM) in seven adult and four children trials (Table 2)..

8699	In addition, the seizure-free rate in treatment and placebo arms were similar in both populations, with 2.8% of adults and 4.5% of children receiving AEDs (p = 0.256), and 0.4% of adults and 0.6% of children receiving placebo (p = 0.607) achieving seizure freedom during the entire treatment period..

8703	By contrast, in children, neither the total nor the adverse events withdrawal rates differed between treatment and placebo arms (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64–1.22] for total withdrawal rate and of 1.24 [0.70–2.20] for adverse events withdrawal rate).	[[142, 144], [129, 131]]	[]	['CI', 'RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml

8705	Accordingly, meta-analysis of the RR ratio demonstrated significant differences between the two populations for the total withdrawal rate, with a ratio of 0.65 (95% CI 0.43–0.98, p = 0.037) pointing to lower RR values in paediatric trials (Figure 5A), a finding confirmed by the meta-regression (p = 0.004).

8711	There was no difference in the RR of withdrawal rate for seizure aggravation between adults (0.74 [95% CI 0.28–1.98], p = 0.55) and children (1.24 [0.70–2.20], p = 0.13), as further demonstrated by the RR ratio (1.24 [0.33–4.62], p = 0.754, Figure 5C) and the meta-regression (p = 0.605).	[[103, 105], [31, 33], [202, 204]]	[]	['CI', 'RR', 'RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8712	In this meta-analysis, we found that the RR of the 50% responder rate for active AEDs over placebo, one of the main measurements of AED efficacy in drug-resistant partial epilepsy, was significantly lower in paediatric trials than in adult ones.	[[81, 84], [132, 135], [41, 43]]	[]	['AED', 'AED', 'RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8713	Such a difference, if ignored, could well result in an underestimation of the placebo response and type II errors in paediatric RCTs..	[[128, 131]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8714	Only five RCTs fulfilling our selection criteria were performed in children, representing one trial per AED.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8715	However, the very consistent findings observed among four of the five selected AEDs strongly suggest that our main result did not depend on any single paediatric trial, but rather on the consistency of the majority of RCTs in children..	[[79, 82], [218, 221]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8716	Our study focused on refractory partial epilepsy, for which AEDs are usually tested during Phases II and III before further evaluation is considered in newly diagnosed epilepsy and refractory generalised epileptic syndromes.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8717	According to these inclusion criteria, it is very unlikely that the patients included in the selected RCTs could have been misdiagnosed..	[[102, 105]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8718	However, differences in the type of partial epilepsy might account for the opposite trend observed for LTG as compared to the four other AEDs, with higher RR of 50% responder rate in children than in adults.	[[137, 140], [103, 106], [155, 157]]	[]	['AED', 'LTG', 'RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8719	Idiopathic partial epilepsies, which are typically benign conditions, are excluded in Phase III RCTs performed in adult patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, and are also unlikely to meet the inclusion criteria of RCTs performed in children with refractory partial seizures.	[[96, 99], [223, 226]]	[]	['RCT', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8720	Accordingly, there was no indication that patients with idiopathic epilepsy were included in the RCTs selected for this meta-analysis, with the exception of the LTG paediatric trial in which 40% of patients were classified as having idiopathic epilepsy [37].	[[161, 164], [97, 100]]	[]	['LTG', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8721	This rate could partly account for the 2-fold higher responder rate observed in children receiving LTG compared to adults (42% versus 20%), a difference not observed for the four other AEDs (GBP, 21% versus 19%; OXC, 40% versus 39%; TPM, 39% versus 44%; LEV, 45% versus 37%)..	[[185, 188], [191, 194], [254, 257], [99, 102], [212, 215], [233, 236]]	[]	['AED', 'GBP', 'LEV', 'LTG', 'OXC', 'TPM']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8722	Although the I2 did not demonstrate significant heterogeneity in our meta-analysis, its upper 95% CI ranged between 50% and 75% in some analyses, and more rarely exceeded the 75% threshold.	[[98, 100]]	[]	['CI']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8723	The reluctance to recruit children with epilepsy into AEDs trials [8] might have resulted in the selection of more severe epilepsy in paediatric than in adult RCTs.	[[54, 57], [159, 162]]	[]	['AED', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8724	In fact, the baseline median monthly seizure frequency was comparable in trials with children and adults for the entire study as well as for four of the five tested AEDs (GBP, LTG, LEV, and OXC).	[[165, 168], [171, 174], [181, 184], [176, 179], [190, 193]]	[]	['AED', 'GBP', 'LEV', 'LTG', 'OXC']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8725	Drug dosages differed between adult and paediatric trials, partly reflecting the fact that the clearance of modern AEDs is 20%–170% higher in children than in adults [7].	[[115, 118]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8726	However, our main findings remain unchanged when we reprocessed all our analyses among a selection of RCTs and study arms that resulted in comparable doses in the two age groups..	[[102, 105]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8727	We used an ITT assessment that may be overly conservative.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['ITT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8728	However, it must be stressed that the same method was used in all the Cochrane systematic reviews of AEDs [35,36,42–48], as well as in previously published meta-analyses [49–51].	[[101, 104]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8729	The major reason for preferring ITT rather than per-protocol analysis is that the criteria used for defining the latter greatly vary between trials and AEDs..	[[152, 155], [32, 35]]	[]	['AED', 'ITT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8730	The overall difference in the RR of being a 50% responder between adult and paediatric trials was primarily related to an age-dependent variation in the response to placebo.	[[30, 32]]	[]	['RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8731	Indeed, placebo 50% responder rate was 1.9 times higher in children than in adults, in a very consistent way across all AEDs, including LTG.	[[120, 123]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8732	It should be remembered, however, that the RCTs considered in our meta-analysis did not include a patient group receiving no intervention.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8733	This regression to the mean effect might be greater in paediatric than in adults RCTs due to several factors, including the marked reluctance of parents to enrol their affected child in placebo-controlled trials [5], the trend observed in this meta-analysis toward shorter baseline duration in paediatric than in adult RCTs, and the possibility of greater short-term changes in seizure frequency in children than in adults..	[[81, 84], [319, 322]]	[]	['RCT', 'RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8734	In contrast to the difference in the RR of the 50% responder rate observed between children and adults, the RR of the seizure-free rate was found to be comparable in the two populations.	[[37, 39], [108, 110]]	[]	['RR', 'RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8735	However, the seizure-free rate was also low in patients receiving AEDs (4.5% in children and 2.8% in adults), accounting for the fact that this outcome failed to show a significant difference between active treatment and placebo arms in the 11 series in which it was available.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8736	Thus, the seizure-free rate, though representing a more clinically relevant and less placebo-sensitive outcome than the 50% responder rate, appears inappropriate for Phase III RCTs in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy..	[[176, 179]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8737	We observed a significantly lower RR of the withdrawal rate in children than in adults, primarily reflecting a greater dropout rate from placebo arms in the former population (13.3%) than in the latter (7%).	[[34, 36]]	[]	['RR']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8738	Indeed, according to the method of last observation carried forward used in all the selected RCTs, patients who withdraw early from the study because of adverse events might be more likely to achieve a 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the shorter time spent in the trial.	[[93, 96]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8739	The impact of our findings on future AED development programs in children needs to be emphasized.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['AED']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8740	Recent reviews and guidelines have established that comprehensive drug development is needed in paediatric populations, including double-blind RCTs, but also have stressed the difficulties in achieving this goal [2,4].	[[143, 146]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml
8741	In fact, two of the five selected RCTs performed in children with drug-resistant partial epilepsy failed to demonstrate a significant difference in the 50% responder rate between the active drug (GBP and TPM) and placebo [54,55], whereas adults trials with the same AEDs and comparable or slightly lower sample sizes all demonstrated significant differences in 50% responder rate between active treatment and placebo [56–58].

8742	We thus need to provide as much precise data as we can to optimally design paediatric RCTs in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['RCT']	[]	PMC2504483.nxml

8837	This large study provides evidence that systemic CRP levels are not responsible for development of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, or diabetes.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8838	We obtained a clear signal, using Mendelian randomization, that the association between systemic CRP and diabetes risk is not causal.	[[97, 100]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8839	However, the nature of the prospective relation between serum CRP and diabetes risk points to the potential effects of more proximal mediators in the inflammatory cascade..	[[62, 65]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8840	Our underlying assumption was confirmed that genetic variants in CRP would not be associated with socioeconomic, lifestyle, and biological confounding factors, enabling us to estimate the unconfounded effect of CRP on HbA1c and HOMA-IR by means of the variation in systemic CRP due to four CRP haplotypes.

8841	In addition to the analysis of Whitehall II data, further support for our conclusion concerning CRP and diabetes is provided by NPHSII and WTCCC.	[[96, 99], [128, 134]]	[]	['CRP', 'NPHSII']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8842	Among almost 2,000 cases of diabetes and 3,000 controls in the WTCCC sample, we were able to identify three SNPs distant from the CRP locus but in tight LD with the SNPs we typed.	[[130, 133], [153, 155], [63, 68]]	[]	['CRP', 'LD', 'WTCCC']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8843	For the CRP haplotypes in question, this is the case here and in other independent studies [15,18,32–38].	[[8, 11]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8844	Third, the Mendelian randomization approach may be open to confounding if the genetic variants used as instruments have multiple effects on phenotype (pleiotropy) or if the variant is in LD with another genetic variant that differently influences the pathway of interest.	[[187, 189]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8845	The variants that we used to generate the CRP haplotypes used here as instrumental variables are in very close LD with variation within a transcription factor binding site located 5′ of the CRP gene, which is associated with circulating concentrations of CRP and thought to be functional [39,40].

8846	It is unlikely that the variation in circulating CRP associated with this marker (or those, like our haplotypes, in LD with it) is substantially involved in other phenotypes affecting inflammatory processes because of their role as a transcription factor binding site.

8849	We find that the rare CGG haplotype is associated with serum CRP level, but we do not replicate the modest link with diabetes observed in the Rotterdam study [4].	[[61, 64]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8850	Among Pima Indians (a population with very high levels of risk for type 2 diabetes) the rs133552 SNP, in the promoter region of CRP, was associated with diabetes risk [42].	[[128, 131]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8851	The CRP haplotypes used in the present study index the rare allele of rs133552, thus it is unlikely that our null finding is due to unmeasured genetic variation.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8852	The consistent lack of association in our primary study, our two replication samples including the large WTCCC, and a large case-control study of Finnish participants [43], provides compelling evidence that CRP is not related to diabetes in European populations.

8853	If glucose intolerance and insulin resistance have inflammatory causes, mediators should be sought among cytokines more proximal than CRP to the start of the inflammatory cascade.	[[134, 137]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml
8854	Gene expression of CRP occurs mainly in hepatocytes, regulated by interleukin (IL)-6 originating from adipocytes and immune tissue.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['CRP']	[]	PMC2504484.nxml

8862	Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a major component of the glial scar.	[[34, 38]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8863	It is considered to be a major obstacle for central nervous system (CNS) recovery after injury, especially in light of its well-known activity in limiting axonal growth.	[[68, 71]]	[[44, 66]]	['CNS']	['central nervous system']	PMC2517615.nxml
8864	Therefore, its degradation has become a key therapeutic goal in the field of CNS regeneration.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['CNS']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8865	Yet, the abundant de novo synthesis of CSPG in response to CNS injury is puzzling.	[[59, 62], [39, 43]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8866	This apparent dichotomy led us to hypothesize that CSPG plays a beneficial role in the repair process, which might have been previously overlooked because of nonoptimal regulation of its levels.	[[51, 55]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8867	We inflicted spinal cord injury in adult mice and examined the effects of CSPG on the recovery process.	[[74, 78]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8868	We used xyloside to inhibit CSPG formation at different time points after the injury and analyzed the phenotype acquired by the microglia/macrophages in the lesion site.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8869	We found that CSPG plays a key role during the acute recovery stage after spinal cord injury in mice.	[[14, 18]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8870	Inhibition of CSPG synthesis immediately after injury impaired functional motor recovery and increased tissue loss.	[[14, 18]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8871	Using the chimeric mice we found that the immediate inhibition of CSPG production caused a dramatic effect on the spatial organization of the infiltrating myeloid cells around the lesion site, decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production by microglia/macrophages, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels.	[[66, 70], [233, 238], [320, 325]]	[[203, 231], [291, 318]]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'TNF-α']	['insulin-like growth factor 1', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha']	PMC2517615.nxml
8872	In contrast, delayed inhibition, allowing CSPG synthesis during the first 2 d following injury, with subsequent inhibition, improved recovery.	[[42, 46]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8873	Using in vitro studies, we showed that CSPG directly activated microglia/macrophages via the CD44 receptor and modulated neurotrophic factor secretion by these cells..	[[39, 43]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8874	Our results show that CSPG plays a pivotal role in the repair of injured spinal cord and in the recovery of motor function during the acute phase after the injury; CSPG spatially and temporally controls activity of infiltrating blood-borne monocytes and resident microglia.	[[22, 26], [164, 168]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8875	The distinction made in this study between the beneficial role of CSPG during the acute stage and its deleterious effect at later stages emphasizes the need to retain the endogenous potential of this molecule in repair by controlling its levels at different stages of post-injury repair..	[[66, 70]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8876	Microglia/macrophage activation can be either beneficial (the cells make IGF-1, a protein that stimulates axon growth) or destructive (the cells make TNF-α, a protein that kills neurons), so studies of microglia/macrophage activation might suggest ways to treat spinal cord injuries.	[[73, 78], [150, 155]]	[]	['IGF-1', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8877	Another possible barrier to recovery is “chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan” (CSPG).	[[76, 80]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8878	But if CSPG prevents spinal cord repair, why is so much of it made immediately after an injury? In this study, the researchers investigate this paradox by asking whether CSPG made in the right place and in the right amount might have a beneficial role in spinal cord repair that has been overlooked..	[[7, 11], [170, 174]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8879	They also examined the injured tissue microscopically, looked for microglia and infiltrating macrophages at the injury site, and measured the production of IGF-1 and TNF-α by these cells.	[[156, 161], [166, 171]]	[]	['IGF-1', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8880	Inhibition of CSPG synthesis immediately after injury impaired the functional recovery of the mice and increased tissue loss at the injury site.	[[14, 18]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8881	It also altered the spatial organization of infiltrating macrophages at the injury site, reduced IGF-1 production by these microglia/macrophages, and increased TNF-α levels.	[[97, 102], [160, 165]]	[]	['IGF-1', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8882	In contrast, when CSPG synthesis was not inhibited until two days after the injury, the mice recovered well from spinal cord injury.	[[18, 22]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8883	Furthermore, the interaction of CSPG with a cell-surface protein called CD44 activated microglia/macrophages growing in dishes and increased their production of IGF-1 but not of molecules that kill neurons..	[[32, 36], [161, 166]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8884	These findings suggest that, immediately after a spinal cord injury, CSPG is needed for the repair of injured neurons and the recovery of movement, but that later on the presence of CSPG hinders repair.	[[69, 73], [182, 186]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8885	The findings also indicate that CSPG has these effects, at least in part, because it regulates the activity and localization of microglia and macrophages at the injury site and thus modulates local immune responses to the damage.	[[32, 36]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8886	However, they suggest that the effect of CSPG on spinal cord repair is not an inappropriate response to the injury, as is widely believed.	[[41, 45]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8887	Consequently, careful manipulation of CSPG levels might improve outcomes for people with spinal cord injuries..	[[38, 42]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8888	The poor recovery of the central nervous system (CNS) following an injury is generally attributed to the accumulation of compounds that mediate self-perpetuating degeneration, the presence of growth inhibitors [1,2], formation of the glial scar [3,4], and a malfunction of the immune response mediated mostly by microglia/macrophages [5–8].	[[49, 52]]	[[25, 47]]	['CNS']	['central nervous system']	PMC2517615.nxml
8889	The extracellular matrix molecule chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a major constituent of the glial scar [1,9–11], and it is intensively secreted following CNS injury.	[[166, 169], [68, 72]]	[[34, 66]]	['CNS', 'CSPG']	['chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan']	PMC2517615.nxml
8890	Its effect on recovery in the CNS has gained a negative reputation that derives mainly from studies in which it was shown to impede axonal regeneration [9,10].	[[30, 33]]	[]	['CNS']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8891	This perception prompted attempts to overcome this obstacle to recovery, especially by the use of chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), a CSPG-degrading enzyme [1,12,13], aimed at elimination of CSPG from the injury site.	[[118, 123], [128, 132], [185, 189]]	[]	['ChABC', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8892	Moreover, the observed spatial and temporal association between CSPG deposition and the local immune response was thought to support the negative roles of both in recovery from CNS injury [3]..	[[177, 180], [64, 68]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
8893	These latter observations, together with the fact that the postinjury increase in CSPG is not restricted to the CNS but is a general phenomenon associated with the healing of wounds [35], led us to postulate that the intense de novo synthesis of CSPG following injury might have a role in the repair process by regulating the local immune response, and that its overall negative reputation might reflect nonoptimal regulation of its production and/or degradation..

9003	Xyloside treatment of spinally injured chimeric mice (with GFP-expressing blood-borne monocytes; Figure 2H) revealed that the disruption of CSPG deposition resulted in an infiltration of blood-borne macrophages into the epicenter of the lesion, an area where they were not found in the presence of CSPG (Figure 2I).	[[140, 144], [298, 302], [59, 62]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'GFP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9004	Thus, our data indicate that the increased IGF-1 expression by microglia and blood-borne monocytes, and the spatial organization of these cells at the lesion site, are related to the presence of CSPG..	[[195, 199], [43, 48]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9005	To address the relevance of CSPG production to the recovery from injury, we first assessed the size of the lesion site by immunohistochemical analysis.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9006	Labeling of astrocytes with GFAP and of microglia/macrophages with IB-4 yielded similar results with respect to the lesion size (Figure 3C), indicating that in the absence of CSPG, tissue damage is markedly increased..	[[175, 179], [28, 32]]	[]	['CSPG', 'GFAP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9007	To further evaluate the relevance of CSPG production to functional recovery, we performed an additional experiment applying xyloside immediately after injury, and assessed the functional recovery using the Basso Mouse Scale, BMS.	[[37, 41]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9008	This result emphasizes that CSPG plays a beneficial role in the spontaneous recovery from spinal cord injury..	[[28, 32]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9009	The observed beneficial role of CSPG and the well-documented inhibitory effect of CSPG on axonal growth [1,9,10] raise an apparent discrepancy.	[[32, 36], [82, 86]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9010	We postulated that this discrepancy reflects a nonoptimal postinjury regulation of CSPG levels and timing.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9011	Thus, for example, although CSPG is needed to induce the neuroprotective phenotype of microglia/macrophages in the acute phase (from immediately after injury to 1 or 2 d later), its continuing production in the subsequent (subacute) phase might be overwhelming and thus inhibits axonal growth.	[[28, 32]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9012	To examine the possibility that timing is crucial factor in the presence of CSPG, we again employed the experimental paradigm of spinal cord injury, but this time applied xyloside at the subacute phase (2 d after injury) so that CSPG biosynthesis was restricted to the acute phase.	[[76, 80], [229, 233]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9013	As a control, we treated an additional group of spinally injured mice with xyloside on day 7 after injury, when CSPG levels are no longer increased, and therefore was not expected to be affected by xyloside treatment (Figure 4A).	[[112, 116]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9014	We subjected the mice to anterograde labeling by injecting the tracer BDA into their motor cortex.	[[70, 73]]	[]	['BDA']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9015	A higher percentage of BDA-labeled fibers could be seen caudally to the lesion site in the group that was treated with xyloside on day 2 after the injury compared to the group that was treated with xyloside immediately after injury (Figures 4F, 4G, and S2).	[[23, 26]]	[]	['BDA']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9016	The different effects of xyloside treatment in the various regimes (day 0, 2, 7) further support the contention that the effect of xyloside is local on CSPG synthesis, rather than an unrelated systemic effect.	[[152, 156]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9017	Examining CSPG levels in the different treatment groups indicated that both in the immediate treatment (day 0) and in the delayed treatment (day 2), there was a decrease in the overall levels of CSPG detected by immunohistochemistry (Figure 4J and 4K) and by Western blotting (Figure 4L)..	[[10, 14], [195, 199]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9018	We found that the inhibition of CSPG synthesis during the subacute phase (delayed [day 2] treatment), resulted in increased IGF-1 immunolabeling (Figure 5A) and increased protein secretion (determined by ELISA; Figure 5B) relative to the PBS control.	[[32, 36], [124, 129]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9019	Treatment on day 7 had no effect on IGF-1 levels.	[[36, 41]]	[]	['IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9020	TNF-α levels, in contrast to those with the immediate inhibition of CSPG synthesis, were not affected by the delayed (day 2) treatment, while the immediate inhibition of CSPG synthesis resulted in increased TNF-α levels (11 ± 1.29 pg/ml in the PBS-treated group versus 16.9 ± 3.1 pg/ml in the xyloside treatment group; Student t-test, p = 0.004; n = 4 mice per group; determined by ELISA)..	[[68, 72], [170, 174], [207, 212]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9021	As described above, CSPG participated in the spatial organization of the microglia/macrophages at the lesion site; in the absence of CSPG (in mice receiving xyloside treatment immediately after the injury), the compartmentalized organization of the site was disrupted and macrophages also invaded the epicenter of the lesion (Figure 2I).	[[20, 24], [133, 137]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9022	We found that when CSPG production was limited to the acute phase by the delayed administration of xyloside, the spatial organization of the microglia/macrophages at the lesion site was maintained (Figure 5C and 5D)..	[[19, 23]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9023	To gain insight into the underlying mechanism of CSPG effects on microglia/macrophages, we employed in vitro assays using primary cultures of mouse microglia.	[[49, 53]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9024	Microglia cultured on an inert substrate, PDL, were used as a basal reference.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9025	Nevertheless, we observed morphological changes in the microglia cultured on CSPG relative to those cultured on PDL (Figure 6A).	[[77, 81], [112, 115]]	[]	['CSPG', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9026	The morphology of microglia cultured on CSPG had a “fried egg” morphology, with flattened and thickened membrane processes and a larger cell body (mean ± SD 37 ± 10 μm in CSPG-cultured microglia versus 21 ± 5.6 μm on a PDL base; Student t-test, p < 0.0001), a morphology associated with microglial activation [47].

9027	Increased incorporation of the cell-proliferation marker BrdU demonstrated significantly increased proliferation of the microglia cultured on CSPG relative to those cultured on PDL (Figure 6B and 6C)..	[[57, 61], [142, 146], [177, 180]]	[]	['BrdU', 'CSPG', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9028	Examination of the direct effect of CSPG on microglial expression of BDNF and IGF-1 in vitro, in line with our results in vivo, revealed an increase in the mRNA of IGF-1 but not of BDNF (Figure 6D).

9029	Analysis of the cells at the protein level revealed an increase in IGF-1 expression in microglia cultured on CSPG relative to those cultured on PDL (Figure 6E and 6F).	[[109, 113], [67, 72], [144, 147]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9030	However, no effect on the expression BDNF was observed (Figure 6E)..	[[37, 41]]	[]	['BDNF']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9031	Comparison of gene arrays of microglia cultured on CSPG versus those grown on PDL (Tables S1–S3) revealed that a group of IGF-1–related genes was increased after incubation of microglia on CSPG but not on PDL.	[[51, 55], [189, 193], [78, 81]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9032	In order to determine whether IGF-1 affects CSPG-activated microglia, and if the effect is autocrine in nature (as our gene array analysis suggested), we assayed the mRNA of IRS-1.	[[44, 48], [30, 35]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9033	Expression of IRS-1 is reportedly increased when microglia are activated by IGF-1 [51].	[[76, 81], [14, 19]]	[]	['IGF-1', 'IRS-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9034	PCR analysis indeed revealed an increase in IRS-1 transcripts in the CSPG-activated microglia (Figure 6G)..	[[69, 73], [44, 49]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IRS-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9035	MMPs are endogenous proteolytic enzymes that can degrade CSPG [52] and are reportedly expressed by activated microglia/macrophages [53,54].	[[57, 61]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9036	Because of the relevance of these enzymes as potential players in the feedback regulation of CSPG levels in injured tissue, we examined the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, two of the most prominent MMPs in the injured CNS.	[[93, 97], [154, 157], [164, 167], [197, 200]]	[]	['CSPG', 'MMP', 'MMP', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9037	mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were analyzed at different time points in microglia cultured on CSPG and compared to microglia cultured on PDL.	[[95, 99], [15, 18], [25, 28]]	[]	['CSPG', 'MMP', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9038	Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 were more abundant in the CSPG-activated microglia than in the microglia cultured on PDL (Figure 6H).	[[47, 51], [5, 8], [15, 18], [106, 109]]	[]	['CSPG', 'MMP', 'MMP', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9039	Compared to MMP-2, MMP-9 levels were increased at an earlier time point.	[[12, 15], [19, 22]]	[]	['MMP', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9040	Our data thus suggest that CSPG can directly activate microglia to express IGF-1 and MMPs..	[[27, 31], [75, 80], [85, 88]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9041	Examination of the microglia cultured on CSPG revealed no detectable increase in nitric oxide (measured in terms of nitrate levels in the cultured media; Figure 6I) or in TNF-α mRNA (Figure 6J) relative to microglia cultured on PDL.	[[41, 45], [171, 176]]	[]	['CSPG', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9042	In agreement with other studies, activation of microglia by LPS resulted in their expression of a cytotoxic phenotype [55] in which nitric oxide and TNF-α were markedly increased (Figure 6I and 6J).	[[60, 63], [149, 154]]	[]	['LPS', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9043	However, when we incubated microglia on CSPG before exposing them to LPS, their TNF-α production, determined by immunocytochemistry, was significantly lower than that produced by LPS-activated microglia that were not pre-exposed to CSPG (Figure 6K and 6M).	[[40, 44], [232, 236], [69, 72], [179, 182], [80, 85]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'LPS', 'LPS', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9044	In addition, the microglia cultured on CSPG, when subsequently exposed to LPS, differed from LPS-activated microglia with respect to the increase in cell-body size (Figure 6L and 6M).	[[39, 43], [74, 77], [93, 96]]	[]	['CSPG', 'LPS', 'LPS']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9045	Taken together, our findings suggest that CSPG can balance out the production of potentially cytotoxic compounds and concomitantly induce expression of specific neurotrophic factors..	[[42, 46]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9046	CD44 is a well-characterized receptor of CSPG [55].	[[41, 45]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9047	To determine whether the interaction of microglia with CSPG occurs, at least in part, via the CD44 receptor, we examined the effect of CD44-neutralizing antibodies on downstream effector molecules.	[[55, 59]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9048	Having first established immunocytochemically that ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurs in CSPG-activated microglia (Figure 7), we showed that such phosphorylation was significantly decreased by the addition of anti-CD44 neutralizing antibodies (Figure 7).	[[84, 88]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9049	CD44 activation has also been shown to induce expression of IGF-1 [57]..	[[60, 65]]	[]	['IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9050	Some of the most important lines of evidence supporting a negative effect of CSPG on CNS repair come from studies in which degradation of CSPG by ChABC, even if it is administered immediately after an insult [1,12], results in improved recovery.	[[146, 151], [85, 88], [77, 81], [138, 142]]	[]	['ChABC', 'CNS', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9051	Those results appear to contradict our present findings that when CSPG biosynthesis is prevented immediately after a spinal cord injury, recovery is worse than spontaneous recovery.	[[66, 70]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9052	In the case of CSPG, its degradation by ChABC results in the formation of a 6-sulfated disaccharide (CSPG-DS) [60], which exhibits potent neuroprotective properties in several models of neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration [60].	[[40, 45], [15, 19], [101, 105]]	[]	['ChABC', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9053	Accordingly, we postulated that at least part of the reported beneficial effect of CSPG degradation might be attributable to this neuroprotective compound (and possibly also to others) formed as a result of its specific enzymatic degradation with ChABC.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9054	To examine the potential beneficial role of CSPG degradation products, we repeatedly injected CSPG-DS intravenously after spinal cord injury in mice.	[[44, 48], [94, 98]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9055	The mean BMS scores used to follow the functional recovery of groups of spinally injured mice treated with CSPG-DS or PBS are shown for each day tested (Figure 8A).	[[9, 12], [107, 111]]	[]	['BMS', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9056	Mice treated with CSPG-DS recovered significantly better than PBS-treated controls, resulting in a degree of hind-limb coordination that was not observed in the PBS-treated group..	[[18, 22]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9057	Immunohistochemical analysis of the lesion site using anti-CSPG antibody revealed that treatment with CSPG-DS had no effect on CSPG levels, indicating that the beneficial effect of CSPG-DS treatment was not caused indirectly by inhibition of CSPG expression (Figure 8C)..	[[59, 63], [102, 106], [127, 131], [181, 185], [242, 246]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'CSPG', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9058	Staining for GFAP and IB-4 indicated significant tissue preservation in the CSPG-DS–treated mice relative to controls treated with PBS (Figure 8D and 8E), so to verify tissue preservation we analyzed the spinal cords of CSPG-DS treated or PBS-treated mice for the presence of descending fibers below the lesion site, using stereotactic anterograde tracing of BDA administered to the motor cortexes (Figure 8F)..	[[359, 362], [76, 80], [220, 224], [13, 17]]	[]	['BDA', 'CSPG', 'CSPG', 'GFAP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9059	We also examined the potential effects of CSPG-DS on microglia in vitro.	[[42, 46]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9060	Incubation of microglia on PDL in the presence of CSPG-DS resulted, as with the intact CSPG, in a dose-dependent increase in IGF-1 levels (Figure 8G and 8H).	[[50, 54], [87, 91], [125, 130], [27, 30]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'PDL']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9061	In contrast to the finding with intact CSPG, we also observed an increase in BDNF levels (Figure 8I and 8J).	[[77, 81], [39, 43]]	[]	['BDNF', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9062	These results showed that intact CSPG and CSPG-DS do not have completely overlapping effects, indicating that they operate via different mechanisms of action.	[[33, 37], [42, 46]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9063	We also examined whether CSPG-DS can balance out the inhibitory effect of LPS on IGF-1 production.	[[25, 29], [81, 86], [74, 77]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'LPS']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9064	By preincubating microglia with CSPG-DS it was possible to overcome the LPS-induced inhibition of IGF-1 expression in vitro (Figure 8G and 8H)..	[[32, 36], [98, 103], [72, 75]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'LPS']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9065	To further study the effect of CSPG-DS in vivo, we examined the injured spinal cords treated with CSPG-DS or PBS for IGF-1 and BDNF (Figure 8K and 8L).	[[127, 131], [31, 35], [98, 102], [117, 122]]	[]	['BDNF', 'CSPG', 'CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9066	Treatment with CSPG-DS significantly increased BDNF and IGF-1 in the injured site.	[[47, 51], [15, 19], [56, 61]]	[]	['BDNF', 'CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9067	The increase in IGF-1-expressing microglia was not restricted to the cells associated with the margins of the lesion (Figure 8L)..	[[16, 21]]	[]	['IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9068	The results of this study suggest that CSPG, an extracellular component of the glial scar, exerts a beneficial effect on CNS recovery from injury, in part by inducing IGF-1 and MMP expression by microglia/macrophages and attenuating TNF-α levels.	[[121, 124], [39, 43], [167, 172], [177, 180], [233, 238]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG', 'IGF-1', 'MMP', 'TNF-α']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9069	Our data further suggest that, following injury to the CNS, CSPG plays a beneficial role in its recovery that can be achieved only by careful regulation of its presence: blockage of CSPG production immediately after spinal cord injury decreased spontaneous recovery, whereas restriction of CSPG biosynthesis to the acute phase improved recovery..	[[55, 58], [60, 64], [182, 186], [290, 294]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9070	The intensive secretion of CSPG reported after a CNS injury [1,10,42] has been largely blamed for the lack of axonal regeneration and the detrimental outcome following injuries to the spinal cord.	[[49, 52], [27, 31]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9071	Moreover, the increase in CSPG observed in various CNS pathologies (such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer disease) [61,62] led to the widespread perception that the postinjury production of CSPG is a manifestation of CNS malfunction.	[[51, 54], [220, 223], [26, 30], [193, 197]]	[]	['CNS', 'CNS', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9072	Accordingly, treatments were developed to overcome the growth-inhibitory effect of this molecule, mainly by inducing its degradation by the specific enzyme ChABC [12].	[[156, 161]]	[]	['ChABC']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9073	The results of the present study, however, highlight a novel aspect of this molecule in regulating the local immune response via modulation of microglia/macrophage expression of IGF-1 and suggest that the postinjury production of CSPG in the acute phase plays an important role in the repair process..	[[230, 234], [178, 183]]	[]	['CSPG', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9074	Using chimeric mice with GFP-expressing blood-borne monocytes, we demonstrated that both microglia and macrophages that were found in CSPG-rich areas expressed IGF-1, a phenomenon that was abolished when CSPG production was inhibited.	[[134, 138], [204, 208], [25, 28], [160, 165]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG', 'GFP', 'IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9075	Thus the present study suggests that CSPG modulates the behavior of microglia/macrophages and thereby affects their contribution to the overall repair process.	[[37, 41]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9076	Nevertheless, in vivo, it is likely that additional factors besides CSPG contribute to the behavior of resident and recruited cells.	[[68, 72]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9077	Moreover, CSPG itself might have additional differential effects on the activation of microglia or macrophages and regulate other aspects of microglial cell/macrophage phenotype (such as phagocytosis or neurotrophic factor secretion)..	[[10, 14]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9078	The direct role of CSPG in controlling microglial and macrophage behavior after spinal cord injury was demonstrated here by blockage of CSPG biosynthesis, rather than inducing its degradation of existing CSPG.	[[19, 23], [136, 140]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9079	Degradation, unlike blockage of biosynthesis, can result in the formation of potentially new CSPG-derived active compounds such as CSPG-DS.	[[93, 97], [131, 135]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9080	Blockage of biosynthesis immediately after the injury resulted in reduced expression of IGF-1 by microglia/macrophages, loss of cellular compartmentalization in the lesion site, and decreased functional recovery relative to untreated controls.	[[88, 93]]	[]	['IGF-1']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9081	In contrast, when CSPG biosynthesis was allowed to take place during the first 2 d and was then inhibited, this treatment resulted in enhanced recovery, preservation of the site organization and of neurotrophic factor levels.	[[18, 22]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9082	Moreover, since both treatments (immediate and delayed to day 2) resulted in overall decrease in CSPG levels, it is likely that the improved recovery observed in the delayed treatment (day 2) should be attributed mostly to the presence of CSPG in the acute phase after injury..	[[97, 101], [239, 243]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9083	Thus, these results indicate that the effect of CSPG after spinal cord injury is not an all-or-none phenomenon; it is a function of timing and level.	[[48, 52]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9084	For example, moderate (rather than intense) application of CSPG-degrading enzymes was reportedly more effective than intensive degradation [66].	[[59, 63]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9085	Other lines of evidence indicate that astrocytes (the main source of CSPG) are required in CNS repair [67,68], specifically in the acute phase after injury, but not in the chronic phase [67].	[[91, 94], [69, 73]]	[]	['CNS', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9086	In agreement with our study, pharmacological blockage of the MMPs, a family of endogenous proteolytic enzymes that degrade CSPG in the glial scar [52], when limited to the first 3 d after spinal cord injury, improves locomotor activity [69].	[[123, 127], [61, 64]]	[]	['CSPG', 'MMP']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9087	Our study further suggests that in those studies in which a beneficial effect of CSPG degradation by ChABC was documented it was, at least in part, an outcome of the production of new molecules, for example disaccharides (CSPG-DS), rather than simply the elimination of CSPG.	[[101, 106], [81, 85], [222, 226]]	[]	['ChABC', 'CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9088	Accordingly, in the present study CSPG-DS did directly modulate the microglial phenotype both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting the levels of CSPG.	[[34, 38]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9089	Although we demonstrated that the intact CSPG and its disaccharidic derivatives can independently affect microglia and promote recovery, we did not rule out the possibility that glycosaminoglycans, the saccharidic component of the proteoglycan, are the relevant active components responsible for the beneficial activity of the intact CSPG..	[[41, 45], [334, 338]]	[]	['CSPG', 'CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9090	The observation that CSPG induces MMP expression by microglia in vitro, in light of the need for temporally regulated degradation of CSPG in the process of repair, might point to a potential feedback regulation of CSPG by the same microglia/macrophages as those activated by it.

9091	To conclude, our study does not argue against the beneficial effect of CSPG degradation, but rather suggests that the timing and the extent of degradation should be carefully selected according to the changing requirements of the ongoing dynamic repair process [70].	[[71, 75]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml
9092	In its intact form, CSPG is required at the early stages of recovery to activate microglia/macrophages and possibly to limit the spread of damage by creating a physical barrier, whereas in the chronic postinjury phase, or when present in excessive amounts, CSPG inhibits axonal growth and regeneration.

9094	Moreover, since CSPG is a major constituent of the glial scar, the present findings raises the potential need to revisit the overall perception of the glial scar and its role in recovery.	[[16, 20]]	[]	['CSPG']	[]	PMC2517615.nxml

9108	If there were no background secretion of PSA by normal cells, the highly sensitive immunoassays that are clinically available for PSA would allow for very low cut-off levels.	[[41, 44], [130, 133]]	[]	['PSA', 'PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9109	However, there is background secretion of PSA by nonmalignant prostate cells.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9110	In screening for prostate cancer, the American Urological Association recommends to proceed to prostate biopsy in patients exceeding the PSA cut-off level 4 ng/ml [26].	[[137, 140]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9111	Some authors even recommend prostate biopsies at PSA levels of 2.6–4 ng/ml in men younger than 60 y [27].	[[49, 52]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9112	Up to 25% of the more aggressive prostate cancer types are found in men with PSA levels below 4 ng/ml, but despite this fact there is fear that lowering the cut-off level might result in overdiagnosing and overtreatment of prostate cancer [17].	[[77, 80]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9113	This value is actually close to a cut-off level calculated by adding 3.09 × the standard deviation to the mean PSA level in healthy 50- to 59-y-old men (4.161 ng/ml) [28].	[[111, 114]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9114	Since normal values of PSA are age dependent, we used a published normal value of 1.38 ng/ml for the age group of 50- to 59-y-old men [28]..	[[23, 26]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9115	Reported PSA secretion rates by the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP are 21 ng/105 cells/ml/24 h and 134 ng/106 cells/ml/24 h, respectively [29,30].	[[9, 12]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9116	In order to account for tumor cell types that might secrete lower amounts of PSA and for potential influences on the cell secretion by the tumor microenvironment (field effects), we chose a broader range of secretion rates for our calculations and added secretion rates as low as 2.1 ng/105 cells/ml/24 h and 10-fold higher than the published value of 134 ng/106 cells/ml/24 h (up to a maximum of 1,340 ng/106 cells/ml/24 h) to the analysis..

9117	When no biomarker secretion by healthy cells was assumed, the required tumor size resulting in detectable PSA levels was defined by the actual detection limit or sensitivity of the proteomics assay (model variables, Table 4).	[[106, 109]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9118	Under the assumption of 10% of the secreted tumor biomarker reaching the intravascular space, the calculated tumor sizes leading to detectable PSA levels in patients' serum ranged between 0.21 mm3 and 131.51 mm3 depending on the assumed tumor cell secretion rates and sensitivity of the blood assay (Table 8).	[[143, 146]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9119	Even an assay sensitivity of 0.01 ng/ml would still be clinically realistic and then decrease the detection levels to a range of 0.21 to 13.15 mm3 under the assumption of 10% of the secreted PSA reaching the intravascular space..	[[191, 194]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml

9121	When biomarker secretion by healthy cells is present, it was assumed that the secretion of PSA by healthy cells accounts for 1.38 ng/ml (normal value for 50- to 59-y-old men) and secretion by tumor cells accounts for the remaining 2.62 ng/ml up to the cut-off level of 4 ng/ml.

9123	By priming the model parameters on the basis of the literature data for two established and well-studied tumor biomarkers, CA125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer, the potential detection limits needed for a proteomic blood test with regards to tumor burden were calculated under varying physiological and assay conditions (Tables 1–4) [6–8,14,20–24,26,28–31].	[[152, 155]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9124	Assuming the same ideal case scenario of exclusive biomarker secretion by tumor cells for prostate cancer, comparably small lesions in a range of 0.21–13.15 mm3 may be detectable even with a clinically available PSA immunoassay (detection limit 0.01 ng/ml).	[[212, 215]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9125	Likewise, in a clinically more realistic scenario for PSA with background secretion of PSA also by healthy prostatic cells, we found that tumor lesions ranged in size between 27 mm3 and 3.45 × 105 mm3 (0.35 l), which approximately corresponds to a size range between 33 mm3 and 70.143 mm3 that can be detected by a serum marker test.	[[54, 57], [87, 90]]	[]	['PSA', 'PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9126	In the clinic, PSA serum levels are known to positively correlate with prostate cancer size.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9127	However, even at low PSA levels of 4 ng/ml, a tumor as big as 10,000 mm3 can already be present, underlining the large physiological variability of tumor marker secretion by tumors in patients [36]..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9128	When biomarker secretion by tumor and normal cells were assumed and sensitivities of clinically available proteomics assays were used for our model analysis, the calculated minimally detectable tumor sizes were smaller for PSA than for CA125 in our study, but still in a comparable range.	[[223, 226]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9129	This may seem surprising, given the much lower cut-off level for differentiation between healthy and disease state for PSA (4 ng/ml) compared with CA125 (34.11 U/ml), the chosen higher tumor cell density for prostate tumors than for ovarian tumors and the comparable range of both biomarker secretion rates.	[[119, 122]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9130	The different measurement units (units/ml for CA125 versus ng/ml for PSA) do not actually matter in this mathematical model, since they cancel each other out during the calculations.	[[69, 72]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9131	However, the plasma half-life is much shorter for PSA than for CA125 (46.08 h for PSA versus 151.2 h for CA125), and the chosen average plasma volume is much larger for men than for women (3,825 ml for men versus 3,150 ml for women) [31].	[[50, 53], [82, 85]]	[]	['PSA', 'PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9132	Therefore, because of the shorter PSA plasma half-life as well as the larger plasma volume in men, more PSA has to be secreted by prostate tumors to reach a steady state level detectable with proteomics assays.	[[34, 37], [104, 107]]	[]	['PSA', 'PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9133	These facts may explain why the calculated minimally detectable tumor sizes were within a comparable range for both biomarkers despite the fact that PSA has a lower cut-off level than CA125..	[[149, 152]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9134	We acknowledge that CA125 and PSA are not ideal cancer screening biomarkers.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9135	Increased PSA levels are also found at high percentages in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy, a disorder with high prevalence in the older male population [38].	[[10, 13]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9136	Accordingly, “normal” PSA levels are closely linked to age and prostate gland size, which is reflected by increasing PSA serum levels with increasing age [28].	[[22, 25], [117, 120]]	[]	['PSA', 'PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9137	On the other hand, high grade cancers, which have an aggressive clinical course with early metastasis and, thus, need to be detected at very early stage for a curative treatment, can present with PSA levels smaller than 4 ng/ml in up to 25% of cases [17].	[[196, 199]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml
9138	For PSA we performed the sensitivity analysis assuming the clinically established and widely recommended cut-off level of 4 ng/ml for differentiating between presence of tumor and no tumor [26].	[[4, 7]]	[]	['PSA']	[]	PMC2517618.nxml

9172	(The authors are not aware of a substantial literature on the response of elasticity after the price increases immediately preceding the year 2000, so it was not possible to evaluate the implied elasticities for this period.) The coefficient of the deterministic time trend of 1.69 packs per capita per year (SE 0.187) suggests a long-run divergence of California and control states per capita cigarette consumption, holding other factors constant (including the effect of the CTCP)..

9173	The CDC estimated an excess health care cost per active smoker of $3,036 annually (in 2004 US dollars) [11].	[[4, 7]]	[]	['CDC']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml
9174	Per capita consumption in the US during 2004 was 90.7 packs [34] and smoking prevalence was 20.4% (SE 0.3% computed using the delta method) [35], which implies direct health costs of $6.88 (SE $0.11) per pack, consistent with previous estimates [10,36].	[[99, 101], [190, 192]]	[]	['SE', 'SE']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml
9175	Using our data over the observation period, the mean difference between California and average control state consumption was 34.3 packs per capita, mean California smoking prevalence in 1992–1993 was 19.4% (SE 0.3%), and mean control state prevalence for the same years was 23.9% (SE 0.1%) [37].	[[207, 209], [281, 283]]	[]	['SE', 'SE']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml
9176	Therefore, the base case control state estimate of $27.00 (SE $1.82) implies an annual cost of smoking per capita of $27.00/(pack per capita) × 34.3 packs per capita = $926, and a cost per smoker of between $926/0.239 = $3,940 (SE $266) and $926/0.194 = $4,800 (SE $330).

9177	While all these variables—as well as exposure to secondhand smoke—have been affected to varying degrees by the CTCP, we cannot disaggregate the contributions of these different mediating variables to the observed changes..	[[111, 115]]	[]	['CTCP']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml
9178	For example, in the US, where the states receive about $25 billion a year from the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement [7,40] that ended state litigation against the tobacco industry and tobacco taxes, only $720 million will be devoted to tobacco control programs in fiscal year 2008 [8], well below the levels that the CDC recommends [2].

9180	The fact that CTCP has been focused on social norm change among adults, not primarily on youth prevention [13], is probably why it was associated with such rapid and large reductions in disease and the associated health care costs.	[[14, 18]]	[]	['CTCP']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml
9181	The erosion of purchasing power due to the fact that the funding for the CTCP has been at a constant $0.05 per pack of cigarettes means that tens of billions of dollars of likely health care expenditure savings have been lost.	[[73, 77]]	[]	['CTCP']	[]	PMC2522256.nxml

9222	The identification of revisions of primary hip and knee replacement within the HES database may have been incomplete.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['HES']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9223	First, the revision procedure must have been carried out in the NHS and not in the independent sector.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['NHS']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9224	Further explorations within the NJR database only indicated that more than 98% of the revisions were carried out in the NHS.	[[32, 35]]	[]	['NJR']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9225	Second, the revisions must be captured by the OPCS-4 codes in the HES database.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['HES']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9226	This percentage was low because the NJR only started in 2003 and case ascertainment and the collection of patient identifiers (needed to link the NJR records with HES records) are gradually improving.	[[163, 166], [36, 39], [146, 149]]	[]	['HES', 'NJR', 'NJR']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9227	Furthermore, and even more importantly, the overall revision rates following the primary hip and knee replacements in the NHS that could not be included was 1.5%, and the corresponding figure following a primary knee replacement was 1.6%.	[[122, 125]]	[]	['NHS']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml
9228	For example, the NJR explicitly excludes re-operations other than revisions [29], whereas the Australian registry explicitly includes minor revisions (revisions that do not include the removal of a component that interfaces with bone with the exception of the patella) [15].	[[17, 20]]	[]	['NJR']	[]	PMC2528048.nxml

9374	In univariate analysis, the same patient characteristics were significantly associated with both whether or not TB transmission occurred (Table 3) and with the degree of patient infectiousness (q, see Text S1; Table 4): sputum smear-positivity, MDR TB versus non-MDR TB, and suboptimal treatment.

9375	Multiple regression analysis of whether or not a patient admission caused TB transmission to guinea pig(s) showed an independent statistically significant association only with MDR status (p = 0.02); TB transmission to guinea pigs was also observed more frequently in admissions of sputum smear-positive (versus smear-negative) patients, but this association was not statistically significant (p = 0.08; Table 3).	[[177, 180], [74, 76], [200, 202]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9376	Predicted probabilities were estimated from an exact multiple logistic regression: the predicted probability of infectiousness was 3% for smear-negative non-MDR TB patients; 18% for patients who were either smear positive or had MDR TB; and 59% for smear-positive MDR TB patients.

9377	Multiple regression analysis of data from all patients identified as having caused TB transmission demonstrated that the degree of patient infectiousness was independently significantly associated with MDR TB; patient infectiousness appeared possibly to increase with sputum-smear positivity and days on the ward without treatment, but these associations were not found to be statistically significant (Table 4).

9380	This research has for the first time (to our knowledge) demonstrated that amongst HIV-positive patients TB infectiousness is extremely variable, that a few HIV-positive patients were highly infectious, and that inadequately treated MDR TB patients accounted for the great majority of TB transmission.

9381	In contrast to seminal studies of TB transmission using a similar guinea-pig method of detection half a century ago, this study was conducted in a real-life busy ward in a low-resource setting with unselected patients, composed of a heterogeneous mix of new and established diagnoses of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, with varying treatment regimens.	[[34, 36], [323, 325]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9382	These results therefore have important implications for TB infection control, especially in the era of increasingly integrated TB and HIV care and the emergence of XDR TB strains..	[[56, 58], [127, 129], [168, 170], [164, 167]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'XDR']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9383	Average patient infectiousness over the whole study period for these HIV-positive TB patients with high rates of MDR TB was up to six times greater than that calculated for the heterogeneous mix of patients in the 1950s studies (q = 1.25) [4,27].	[[113, 116], [82, 84], [117, 119]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9384	Three highly infectious patients were observed, all with MDR TB, with q-values of 40, 52, and 226.	[[57, 60], [61, 63]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9385	It should be noted that these q-values reflect TB transmission from humans to guinea pigs.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9386	Thus some caution is needed in comparing the infectiousness of patients in this study with published q-values calculated for human-to-human transmission, such as q = 13 for an untreated office worker who infected 27 coworkers over 4 wk prior to diagnosis [31], and q = 250 for an outbreak associated with intubation and bronchoscopy of a TB patient [11,27].	[[338, 340]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9387	However, comparisons can be drawn with q-values calculated for Riley's study: q = 1.25 average for all patients; q = 60 for the most infectious case, with laryngeal TB [27].	[[165, 167]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9388	This model for identifying infectious patients required TB strains to be not only transmissible to guinea pigs, but also sufficiently virulent to cause disease from which a strain could be recovered with corresponding spoligotype.	[[56, 58]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9389	Animals with positive PPD skin test conversions but culture negative for TB were observed throughout the study.	[[73, 75]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9390	The relative infectiousness of patients in this study was highly variable, and a patient with MDR TB was found to be highly infectious, producing 226 infectious quanta/h.	[[94, 97], [98, 100]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9391	The TB strain responsible, not a Beijing strain, was also seen in a second highly infectious MDR TB patient, producing 52 infectious quanta/h.	[[93, 96], [4, 6], [97, 99]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9392	The finding that sputum smear positivity was associated with TB transmission concurs with previous studies [5–7].	[[61, 63]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9393	The effect of treatment on the infectiousness of TB patients is also well known [2,5], with numbers of viable bacteria falling precipitously following initiation of effective chemotherapy [34,35].	[[49, 51]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9394	Whilst some data suggest that apparent cure of MDR TB may be achieved with first-line drugs [36,37], other studies have shown poor outcomes for such patients [38].	[[47, 50], [51, 53]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9395	The current study shows how suboptimal treatment of MDR TB patients is likely to facilitate ongoing TB transmission.	[[52, 55], [56, 58], [100, 102]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9396	There is conflicting evidence concerning the relative transmissibility of MDR versus drug-susceptible TB strains [14–20].	[[74, 77], [102, 104]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9397	In this study, patients with MDR TB were significantly more likely than those without MDR TB to transmit TB to guinea pigs.	[[29, 32], [86, 89], [33, 35], [90, 92], [105, 107]]	[]	['MDR', 'MDR', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9398	However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of colinearity with suboptimal treatment (5 of 6 identified infectious MDR TB patients were on suboptimal regimens, and the other had treatment initiation delayed for 11 days whilst suitable medications were acquired).	[[136, 139], [140, 142]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9399	Regardless, the high relative infectiousness of inadequately treated MDR TB patients demonstrated in this study underscores the importance of prompt specific treatment guided by rapid drug-susceptibility testing, rather than restricting MDR TB testing and specific therapy to patients who survive failing empiric first-line therapy, as currently happens in most low-resource settings.	[[69, 72], [237, 240], [73, 75], [241, 243]]	[]	['MDR', 'MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9400	It also has important implications for hospital policies that allow suboptimally treated MDR TB cases to be cared for in multi-bedded rooms..	[[89, 92], [93, 95]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9401	The highly infectious nature of some of the HIV-positive MDR TB patients identified in this study has important implications for TB infection control.	[[57, 60], [61, 63], [129, 131]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9402	As the infectiousness of a TB source increases, the relative protection provided by dilutional room ventilation decreases [31] and may become inadequate at the relatively low levels of air exchange usually provided by mechanical ventilation.	[[27, 29]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9403	High rates of ventilation would be required to provide protection from the extremely infectious newly diagnosed MDR TB case observed in this study.	[[112, 115], [116, 118]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9404	Achieving this through mechanical means is an expensive solution for much of the world where TB is most prevalent.	[[93, 95]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9405	In contrast, well-designed natural ventilation [40] provides high ventilation rates for little cost, and furthermore is highly applicable to areas such as crowded waiting rooms where infectious, untreated TB patients are most likely to be encountered.	[[205, 207]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9406	The need for strengthened TB infection control is also highlighted by the recent outbreak of XDR TB amongst HIV-coinfected patients in South Africa; this outbreak was predominantly nosocomial and resulted in extremely high mortality [41].	[[26, 28], [97, 99], [93, 96]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'XDR']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9407	The variability of infectiousness of patients demonstrated in this study highlights the usefulness of a potential test for TB infectiousness that would allow targeted isolation of the most infectious patients in the settings where isolation facilities are sparse, as is unfortunately the case in much of the world where TB is most prevalent.	[[123, 125], [320, 322]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9408	One patient in our study, with MDR TB, infected over half of the guinea pig colony.	[[31, 34], [35, 37]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9409	The first is the incomplete set of spoligotyping data, with results in only 49 of 118 pulmonary TB admissions.	[[96, 98]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9410	Most patients without spoligotype results had negative sputum cultures, and whilst smear-negative TB transmission occurs [8], smear-positive patients account for the majority [5–7].	[[98, 100]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9411	Indeed the two clusters of MDR TB guinea pigs with unidentified infectious sources became infected at times corresponding to the ward residency of smear-positive MDR TB patients without spoligotype results.

9412	We cannot exclude the possibility that guinea pig infections occurred from staff or visitors with TB, however all staff and visitors wore particulate respirators.	[[98, 100]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9413	The Wells-Riley model has inherent limitations [42], but these do not influence evaluations of relative infectiousness, and it allows comparison with published values of TB infectiousness calculated using the same model.	[[170, 172]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9414	The design of this study did not permit determination of the duration of patient infectiousness because of the interval of one month between skin tests, and the variability in the period required for these guinea pigs to become PPD positive following TB infection.	[[251, 253]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9415	However, in univariate analyses patient days on the ward was not significantly associated with TB transmission.	[[95, 97]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9416	The relatively narrow age range and the small number of women amongst the patients is a further limitation of this study, because both young age and male sex have been associated with TB transmission to contacts [15,43].	[[184, 186]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9417	Because all patients were HIV positive, our study was unable to yield evidence concerning the infectiousness of HIV-positive versus HIV-negative MDR TB patients, and this could be a future area of study using our airborne infection facility..	[[145, 148], [149, 151]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9418	In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the potential of HIV-positive patients with MDR TB to be highly infectious.	[[87, 90], [91, 93]]	[]	['MDR', 'TB']	[]	PMC2535657.nxml
9419	With the great majority of TB transmission in this study occurring from inadequately treated MDR TB patients, these results identify the importance of early drug susceptibility testing and initiation of effective chemotherapy for drug-resistant TB to prevent ongoing transmission and facilitate TB control.

9454	Therefore, we evaluated the publication status of trials submitted to the FDA for a wide variety of approved drugs and identified factors associated with publication..	[[74, 77]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml

9456	We included only new drugs classified as “new molecular entities,” which are drug products that have never been previously approved by the FDA for any indication, hereafter referred to as “new drug.” For each new drug, we retrieved the FDA Summary Basis for Approval and evaluated the medical and statistical review documents to identify clinical trials submitted by the sponsor.	[[139, 142], [236, 239]]	[]	['FDA', 'FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9457	The phase of a trial was often not reported in the FDA documents.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9458	Sponsors and the FDA frequently categorize certain trials as “pivotal.” These are trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drug for its proposed indication and provide the most useful information for clinical decision-making.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9459	In practice, trials that are reported in the “clinical studies” or “clinical efficacy” section of the FDA-approved drug label are considered pivotal.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9460	We used this scheme to categorize trials as “pivotal” or “nonpivotal.” We obtained the product label at the time of FDA approval for each new drug, or the next available product label if the initial product label was not available, at http://www.fda.gov/cder/approval/index.htm.	[[116, 119]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9461	For each submitted trial, we recorded the following characteristics when available in the FDA documents: drug name (generic and trade), the number and location of study sites, the name of the principal investigator, the number of study participants, dosage and evaluation schedules, sample size, statistical significance of the primary outcome (p < 0.05 or confidence interval [CI] excluding no difference; or if the study was an equivalency study, p > 0.05 or CI including no difference or a CI excluding the prespecified difference described in the trial).

9464	We systematically searched common databases of biomedical journals that a typical clinician, consumer, or policy maker living in the US would reasonably search.	[[133, 135]]	[]	['US']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9465	These databases were PubMed, Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL).	[[114, 120]]	[]	['CINAHL']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml

9495	We found that after a minimum of 5.5 y of follow-up after FDA approval, we identified publications from 43% of the trials in the medical literature.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9496	We could not test whether similar publication bias exists for trials supporting unsuccessful new drug applications because adequate information about these applications was unavailable from the FDA or other government or commercial sources..	[[194, 197]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9497	We also found the reporting of clinical trials in the FDA review documents and drug labels to be variable in detail and content, and not an adequate substitute for full publication in the medical literature.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9498	We also noted sections of redacted information in the FDA review documents.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9499	Neither the FDA review documents nor the drug labels followed a standard format for reporting a trial's methodology and results.	[[12, 15]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9500	Use of guidelines such as the revised CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [18] may help to improve the quality and completeness of trial reporting in FDA review documents as others have proposed [19]..	[[167, 170]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9501	First, we may have misclassified some published trials as being unpublished because of difficulties in matching publications to incomplete trial descriptions in the FDA documents.	[[165, 168]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9502	We believe our searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL reflect such a reasonable search.	[[61, 67]]	[]	['CINAHL']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9503	The effect of this and other related Web sites on public disclosure of trial data submitted to the FDA requires further research as the information reported in these databases may not be peer reviewed and there is no guarantee that the reporting is complete for all relevant data.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9504	Despite these limitations, our study provides ample evidence that in the years immediately following FDA approval that are most relevant to public health, there exists incomplete and selective publication of trials supporting approved new drugs.	[[101, 104]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9505	As discussed above, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 mandates basic public results reporting for all trials supporting FDA-approved drugs and devices.	[[24, 27], [117, 120]]	[]	['FDA', 'FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml
9506	Moreover, because published trial reports are often incomplete [26] and have been shown to selectively report favorable outcome results [27], the published evidence supporting FDA-approved drugs may be even more skewed than our results suggest.	[[176, 179]]	[]	['FDA']	[]	PMC2553819.nxml

9521	Two-stage pooled analyses of RRs, stratified by source of birth size information, showed that the risk of breast cancer in singletons increased with increasing birth weight categories in studies based on birth records or on parental recalls in childhood (although significant only for the first, p for linear trend (pt) = 0.001), but not in those based on adult reports (Figure 1; study-specific estimates available in Table S4).

9522	A 0.5-kg increment (about one SD) in birth weight was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk in studies based on birth records (pooled RR = 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.09]; p = 0.002) and a borderline significant increase in those based on parental recalls when the women were children, but not in studies based on adult reports, with statistical evidence of heterogeneity between birth weight data sources (p = 0.003).

9523	There was evidence of between study-design heterogeneity of the continuous birth weight effect (p = 0.03), but it was accounted for by differences in birth data sources when examined via meta-regression of the birth weight RRs on both study design and birth data sources (p-value for study-type heterogeneity = 0.67; for adult reports versus other sources = 0.08)..

9526	Women with a head circumference ≥35 cm had an 11% increase (95% CI −5% to 29%) in risk relative to those in the baseline category, whereas those with a head circumference <33 cm had a 10% decrease (95% CI −30% to 15%) (pt = 0.01) (Figure 3).

9527	These estimates corresponded to pooled RRs of 1.06 (95% CI 1.03–1.10) per one SD (= 2 cm) increment in birth length (Figure 4) and 1.09 (1.03–1.15) per one SD (= 1.5 cm) increment in head circumference (Figure S4).

9528	In contrast, there was no association with categorical (Figure 3) or continuous PI (pooled RR per 2.5 kg/m3 increment = 1.01; 0.97–1.04; Figure S3; study-specific estimates available in Table S6)..	[[80, 82], [91, 93]]	[]	['PI', 'RR']	[]	PMC2553821.nxml
9529	The two twin case-control studies, both based on birth records, showed stronger associations of breast cancer risk with continuous birth weight (pooled RR per one SD increment = 1.57; 95% CI 1.20–2.07) and continuous birth length (1.23; 1.01–1.49) than those found among singleton studies, and a positive association with PI (1.36; 1.06–1.75) that was not observed in the latter (Figure S5).

9530	In the subset of singletons in cohort studies based on birth records, all with continuous birth size data, the one-stage pooled dose-response plot for birth weight suggested a nonlinear (quadratic) relationship, with RR for women at the extremes of the distribution being slightly lower than predicted by the linear model.	[[217, 219]]	[]	['RR']	[]	PMC2553821.nxml
9531	Even variables that were significantly associated with birth size, such as maternal height and maternal parity (e.g., correlation coefficients with birth length: r = 0.24 and r = 0.07, respectively; p < 0.001 for both), woman's adult height (r = 0.29, p < 0.001) and parental and woman's adulthood measures of socioeconomic status (SES) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), did not explain the positive association with breast cancer risk.

9532	Similarly, adjustment for the woman's adult body mass index (BMI) did not affect the birth size effects (Figures 5 and 6).	[[61, 64]]	[[44, 59]]	['BMI']	['body mass index']	PMC2553821.nxml
9533	Neither continuous gestational age (pooled RR per 1 wk increment = 0.99; 95% CI 0.96–1.03) or being preterm (unpublished data) was associated with breast cancer risk.	[[77, 79], [43, 45]]	[]	['CI', 'RR']	[]	PMC2553821.nxml
9534	Few studies collected data on the woman's use of oral contraceptives (OC) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (Table S3), but their findings indicate that the birth size–breast cancer associations reported here are unlikely to have been confounded by ever use of these exogenous hormones (minimally adjusted and OC-adjusted pooled RRs per 2 cm increment in birth length: 1.14 (95% CI 0.82–1.61) and 1.14 (0.82–1.61), respectively; similarly, minimally adjusted and HRT-adjusted pooled RRs: 1.08 (0.92–1.25) and 1.07 (0.86–1.34), respectively)..

9538	A moderate correlation of birth size with pregnancy hormone levels of about r = 0.35, as found with maternal oestriol [49,59], implies that the observed RR of 1.06 per one SD increment in birth weight would correspond to a RR as large as 1.17 for one SD increase in the underlying true exposure (although the corresponding 95% CI would be wider).

9539	Similarly, the woman's BMI in adulthood did not confound the birth size–breast cancer associations.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2553821.nxml
9540	This was true even at premenopausal ages when adult BMI was inversely associated with breast cancer risk and thus any potential confounding by this variable would have lead to an underestimation of the true birth size effects..	[[52, 55]]	[]	['BMI']	[]	PMC2553821.nxml
9541	The RR per one SD increment in birth length of 9% is of similar magnitude to that associated with one SD increase in adult height in our data, and similar to an increase of about 7% for each additional 10 g of alcohol consumed on a daily basis [64].

9542	The prevalence of high birth weight has been increasing in many countries [65,66], consequent to rises in maternal prepregnancy BMI and maternal weight gain during pregnancy [67–69], but as this increase appears to reflect mainly rises in PI rather than birth length [70] it may not necessarily translate into an increase in the population attributable fraction.

9595	The findings suggest that childhood lead exposure is associated with volume loss in considerable portions of the prefrontal cortex, including the ACC and the VLPFC.	[[146, 149]]	[]	['ACC']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9596	The ACC, a component of the brain's limbic system positioned about the rostrum of the corpus callosum, processes cognitive and emotional information separately with distinguishable territories (reviewed in [29]).	[[4, 7]]	[]	['ACC']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml

9598	Volume loss in all of the aforementioned frontal brain regions, including both the cognitive and emotional territories of the ACC (Brodmann areas detailed in Table 2), is consistent with and potentially explanatory for cognitive and behavioral problems previously associated with lead exposure [8,12–14,28,35,36].These problems include general intellectual and executive functioning, antisocial behaviors, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

9599	In analyses of brain volumes and measures of cognitive function in adult organolead manufacturing workers, Schwartz and colleagues [22] showed that larger ROI volumes were associated with better cognitive function in five of six cognitive domains (visuoconstruction, processing speed, visual memory, executive functioning, and eye–hand coordination).

9601	Given this critical time period in brain development and maturation with documented low to moderate level of lead exposure in the CLS cohort, the finding of reduced volume within the medial frontal lobe of the adult brains associated with increased childhood blood lead concentration is consistent with lead exposure impairing cortical development and maturation.	[[130, 133]]	[]	['CLS']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9602	However, the changes in volume detected by the VBM method could represent a variety of changes (i.e., neuronal size, reductions of dendritic arborization, or changes in neuropil) at the cellular level [43].	[[47, 50]]	[]	['VBM']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9603	Experimental models with pathological analyses and possibly imaging studies could further complement the changes revealed by the findings of this VBM study.	[[146, 149]]	[]	['VBM']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9604	Evidence from behavioral studies in the CLS cohort, other epidemiological cohorts, and animal models indicate that males are more vulnerable to the effects of lead on executive function [28,36].	[[40, 43]]	[]	['CLS']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9605	The higher incidence of ADHD and antisocial behaviors in males may be similarly consistent with greater susceptibility to childhood lead exposure.	[[24, 28]]	[]	['ADHD']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9606	Braun and colleagues found that children with blood lead levels greater than 2 μg/dl (0.097 μmol/l), representing the top quintile of 4- to 15-y-old children in the United States, were four times more likely to have doctor-diagnosed ADHD [35].	[[233, 237]]	[]	['ADHD']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9607	The significance and implications of the volume loss in the VLPFC and ACC in males are potentially profound.	[[70, 73], [60, 65]]	[]	['ACC', 'VLPFC']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9608	Furthermore, the sample was relatively homogenous with respect to sociodemographic variables such as SES and ethnicity, thus decreasing the extent to which strong confounding factors might generate spurious associations.	[[101, 104]]	[]	['SES']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9609	Compared with VBM studies of psychiatric illnesses, we used a rigorous and conservative minimum contiguous cluster size and statistical criteria for significance (700 voxels, unadjusted p < 0.001) [33,48–50].	[[14, 17]]	[]	['VBM']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml
9610	The VBM approach to quantifying brain volume eliminates bias from errors in the manual delineation of brain structures found with tracing studies.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['VBM']	[]	PMC2689675.nxml

9618	Primary peer-reviewed studies have been searched to assess the incidence of LTBI and/or TB within prisons published until June 2010; both inmates and prison staff were considered.	[[76, 80], [88, 90]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9619	Studies, which were independently screened by two reviewers, were eligible for inclusion if they reported the incidence of LTBI and TB disease in prisons.	[[123, 127], [132, 134]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9620	Five studies from the US and one from Brazil were available to assess the incidence of LTBI in prisons, while 19 studies were available to assess the incidence of TB.	[[87, 91]]	[]	['LTBI']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9621	The median estimated annual incidence rate ratio (IRR) for LTBI and TB were 26.4 (interquartile range [IQR]: 13.0–61.8) and 23.0 (IQR: 11.7–36.1), respectively.

9622	The median estimated fraction (PAF%) of tuberculosis in the general population attributable to the exposure in prisons for TB was 8.5% (IQR: 1.9%–17.9%) and 6.3% (IQR: 2.7%–17.2%) in high- and middle/low-income countries, respectively..

9623	The very high IRR and the substantial population attributable fraction show that much better TB control in prisons could potentially protect prisoners and staff from within-prison spread of TB and would significantly reduce the national burden of TB.

9625	Every year, nearly 10 million people develop tuberculosis (TB)—a contagious bacterial infection usually of the lungs—and nearly two million people die from the disease.	[[59, 61]]	[[45, 57]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3006353.nxml
9626	However, the bacteria remain dormant (latent) within the body, and a latent TB infection (LTBI) can cause active disease many years after the initial infection if host immunity declines.	[[90, 94], [76, 78]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9627	The symptoms of TB include a persistent cough, weight loss, and night sweats.	[[16, 18]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml

9629	Last century, global control efforts began to reduce the incidence (number of new cases in a population in a given time) and prevalence (the number of affected people in a population) of LTBI and TB in many countries.	[[187, 191], [196, 198]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9630	Consequently, it is important to identify settings where TB transmission is particularly high.	[[57, 59]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9631	In these facilities, overcrowding, late case detection, inadequate treatment, and poor implementation of infection control measures (including incomplete segregation of people with active TB) might increase the TB transmission rate.	[[188, 190], [211, 213]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml

9633	Here, the researchers undertake a systematic review (a study that uses predefined criteria to identify all the research on a given topic) to investigate the incidence of TB in prisons..	[[170, 172]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9634	The researchers identified 23 studies that reported the incidence of LTBI and/or TB in prisons among both staff and prisoners.	[[69, 73], [81, 83]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9635	They estimated the incidence of TB in relevant general populations using World Health Organization data; estimates of the incidence of LTBI in the general population came from the studies themselves.	[[135, 139], [32, 34]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9636	The researchers then calculated the ratio between the incidence rates for LTBI and TB in prison and in the general population (incidence rate ratios or IRRs) for each study.	[[152, 155], [74, 78], [83, 85]]	[[127, 147]]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB']	['incidence rate ratio']	PMC3006353.nxml
9637	For both LTBI and TB, the IRR varied widely between studies.	[[26, 29], [9, 13], [18, 20]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9638	The average IRR for LTBI was 26.4.	[[12, 15], [20, 24]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9639	That is, the average incidence of LTBI in prisons was 26.4 times higher than in the general population; the average IRR for TB was 23.0.	[[116, 119], [34, 38], [124, 126]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9640	The researchers also estimated the fraction of TB in the general population attributable to within-prison exposure to M.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9641	Again, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies but, on average, the PAF% for TB in high-income countries was 8.5% (that is, one in 11 cases of TB in the general population was attributable to within-prison spread of TB); in middle-to-low–income countries, the average PAF% was 6.3%..	[[94, 96], [160, 162], [233, 235]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9642	These findings suggest that the risk of LTBI and TB is at least an order of magnitude higher in prisons than in the general population and that the within-prison spread of LTBI and TB is likely to substantially affect the incidence of LTBI and TB in the general population.	[[40, 44], [172, 176], [235, 239], [49, 51], [181, 183], [244, 246]]	[]	['LTBI', 'LTBI', 'LTBI', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9643	Even so, these findings suggest that improvements in TB control in prisons would not only help to protect prisoners and staff from within-prison spread of TB but would also reduce national TB burdens.	[[53, 55], [155, 157], [189, 191]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9644	Further studies are now needed to identify the specific conditions in prisons that influence TB transmission so that rational policies can be developed to improve TB control in correctional facilities..	[[93, 95], [163, 165]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9645	The World Health Organization provides information on all aspects of TB, including information on TB in prisons and on the Stop TB Partnership (some information is in several languages).	[[69, 71], [98, 100], [128, 130]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml

9647	Occurrence of active tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is usually reported to be much higher than the average levels reported for the corresponding general population [1],[2].	[[35, 37]]	[[21, 33]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3006353.nxml
9648	In prisons located in developing countries TB has been reported as the most common cause of death [3].	[[43, 45]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9649	High levels of TB in prison populations are likely to be attributable to the fact that a disproportionate number of prisoners are from population groups already at high risk of TB infection and TB disease (for example, alcohol or drug users, homeless people, mentally ill individuals, former prisoners, and illegal immigrants from areas characterized by high TB prevalence).	[[15, 17], [177, 179], [194, 196], [359, 361]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9650	In addition, overcrowding, late case detection, inadequate treatment of infectious cases, high turnover of prisoners, and poor implementation of TB infection control measures are all known factors contributing to transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	[[145, 147]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9651	Finally, prisoners may be at risk of rapid progression of latent TB infection (LTBI) to TB disease following recent infection or reactivation of latent infection through coexisting pathology, particularly HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and poor nutritional status [3],[4]..	[[79, 83], [65, 67], [88, 90]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9652	Moreover, prisons represent a reservoir for disease transmission to the community at large; the TB infection may spread into the general population through prison staff, visitors, and close contacts of released prisoners [5].	[[96, 98]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9653	The transmission dynamics between prisoners and the general population has been hypothesized to play a key role in driving overall population-level TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates [4]..	[[148, 150]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9654	Overlooking TB prevention and control in prisons settings can carry serious consequences for both prisoners and the general community, in particular in those countries where poor TB control, lack of TB infection control measures, and incarceration rates are high [3]..

9655	The main objectives of the present study were to assess, by reviewing the published literature, the consequences of within-prison spread of TB, estimating the relative risk and risk difference for incident latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease in prisons worldwide, as compared to the incidence in the corresponding local general population and the fraction (percent) of LTBI and TB in the general population attributable (PAF%) to the exposure in prisons.

9694	Finally, using the estimated annual incidence of LTBI and annual TB IRR and the reported population proportion of inmates for each country of interest we estimated the PAF%.	[[68, 71], [49, 53], [65, 67]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9695	The median population in prison (per 1,000 inhabitants) was 4.7 (IQR: 1.4–7.4) for high-income countries and 6.1 (IQR: 1.9–6.1) for middle/low-income countries..	[[65, 68], [114, 117]]	[]	['IQR', 'IQR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9696	The median estimated PAF% for LTBI was 13.1% (IQR: 8.1%–30.0%) for studies from high-income countries (US) and 10.4% for the only study from a middle-income country.	[[46, 49], [30, 34]]	[]	['IQR', 'LTBI']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9697	The median estimated PAF% for TB was 8.5% (IQR: 1.9%–17.9%) for studies from high-income countries and 6.3% (IQR: 2.7%–17.2%) for studies from middle-low–income countries..	[[43, 46], [109, 112], [30, 32]]	[]	['IQR', 'IQR', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9698	Figure 4 shows the PAF% (on a log scale) for TB as a function of both the proportion of population in prison and the IRR between prisoners and general population.	[[117, 120], [45, 47]]	[]	['IRR', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9699	As an example, Jones [20] and Koffi [22] reported similar IRRs—34 and 33 respectively—but due to the different proportions of the population that are in prison the estimated PAF% diverge widely (19.7% versus 1.5%).	[[58, 61]]	[]	['IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9700	On the other hand, Fernandez de la Hoz and Wong [32] reported from countries with similar proportions of incarcerated population, 1.4 and 1.7 per 1000 population respectively, but the large difference in IRR produces a substantial shift in the estimated PAF% (4% versus 0.4%)..

9704	Similarly, accounting in univariate metaregression analyses for overcrowding of the prison setting, presence/absence of ventilation systems, strategies of isolation of suspected TB cases, and TST or TB testing at entry into prison did not show any significant effect on decreasing the between-study variance.	[[178, 180], [199, 201], [192, 195]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TST']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9705	However, the IRR estimated from Wong et al.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9706	[32], the study with the highest quality scoring, differed significantly from the IRR estimated from studies with the lowest quality scoring.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9707	In this study we attempt to summarize the published evidence of incidence of both LTBI and TB in prisons.	[[82, 86], [91, 93]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9708	The present systematic review confirms, using peer-reviewed data from both high- and middle/low-income countries, that the risk for TB is at least one order of magnitude greater in prisons than in the general population, as reported by Aerts et al.	[[132, 134]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9709	The magnitudes of IRR for LTBI and TB estimated in the present systematic review are consistent with each other.	[[18, 21], [26, 30], [35, 37]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9710	Furthermore the finding that the median IRR for LTBI (26.4; IQR: 13.0–61.8) is comparable to that for TB (23.0; IQR: 11.7–36.1) is in line with findings from previous reports and suggests that incident TB cases have a greater impact on subsequent transmission than does importation of LTBI [39].	[[60, 63], [112, 115], [40, 43], [48, 52], [285, 289], [102, 104], [202, 204]]	[]	['IQR', 'IQR', 'IRR', 'LTBI', 'LTBI', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9711	However, in settings where screening is performed at entry in prison, incident TB cases may represent some LTBI importation.	[[107, 111], [79, 81]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9712	Direct evidence, based on molecular genotyping and drug susceptibility testing, of TB transmission in prisons was recently provided by Matthys et al.	[[83, 85]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9713	Although in some countries the number of TB cases in prisons represents a relevant proportion of the overall burden of the disease, data on TB in prisons are not always reported to ministries of health [41].	[[41, 43], [140, 142]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9714	Thus, the TB incidence statistics used for international reporting may be flawed.	[[10, 12]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9715	This underreporting may help to limit a potential bias in our estimates for the IRR (and therefore PAF%), with prisoners being compared to a truly unexposed population; by contrast, if in some countries data from prisons were merged with that of the general population, IRR could have been underestimated.	[[80, 83], [270, 273]]	[]	['IRR', 'IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9716	However, those who enter and exit prisons are more likely to belong to population subgroups at a higher risk for LTBI and TB disease than the general population, such as illegal immigrants, hard-to-reach people (such as the homeless), and underserved ethnic-social minorities.	[[113, 117], [122, 124]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9717	A higher risk of transmission outside of the prisons with respect to the general population may lead to an overestimation of IRRs, since a fraction of the transmission occurring within the community would be attributed to the prison setting..	[[125, 128]]	[]	['IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9718	The PAF% values given here should be considered estimates of the real impact of transmission of TB within prisons, depicting the two main forces acting on such an impact: the proportion of the population in prison and the role of measures to control transmission.	[[96, 98]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9719	Thus, our estimates cannot capture the consequences of introducing TB control measures on transmission dynamics within a prison or between a prison and the local community [1].	[[67, 69]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9720	As a consequence, not only have prison outbreaks of TB been linked to an increased incidence of TB in local communities, but mass incarceration in Central Asian and Eastern European countries has been associated with the increase of TB rates in the general population [4]..	[[52, 54], [96, 98], [233, 235]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9721	Education on early identification of TB and early case management, screening of inmates at arrival, isolation of cases with positive sputum smears—within the framework of community health services when necessary [5],[42]—all represent potentially effective measures.	[[37, 39]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9722	Nevertheless, emphasis should always be placed on control of TB transmission, especially in periods of growth of prison populations [4]..	[[61, 63]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9723	In high- and middle/low-income countries, the maximum possible reduction of the median TB annual incidence in prisons was estimated to be 187 and 1,893 per 100,000 population, respectively.	[[87, 89]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9724	Although assessing the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of TB transmission control measures is beyond the scope of this paper, such a potential reduction of TB incidence in prisons would make attractive a range of infection control strategies..	[[65, 67], [163, 165]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9725	The PAF% for TB and LTBI in high- and medium/low-income countries ranges from 4.5% to 10.4%; however, figures for high-income countries are driven by data from the US, the country with the largest prison population.	[[20, 24], [13, 15]]	[]	['LTBI', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9726	Nonetheless, data from the US could provide useful insights into the epidemiology of TB in prisons: The IRRs for LTBI and TB are consistent.	[[104, 107], [113, 117], [85, 87], [122, 124]]	[]	['IRR', 'LTBI', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9727	[21] showed that a reduction of IRR from 25 to 6.8 may have halved the PAF% from 62.3% to 30.7%..	[[32, 35]]	[]	['IRR']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9728	The high heterogeneity between studies did not allow a pooled analysis of the data; similar levels of heterogeneity have been observed in other systematic reviews focusing on control of TB transmission and those analyzing observational studies [44],[45].	[[186, 188]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9729	Unfortunately, the meta-regression analyses testing for the potential effect on the between-study heterogeneity of prison overcrowding, implementation of TB infection control interventions, strategies of isolation of suspected TB cases, TST or TB testing upon entry into prison, and study quality scoring did not show any significant role for these factors.	[[154, 156], [227, 229], [244, 246], [237, 240]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB', 'TST']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9730	It has been shown that the direct comparison of the TB rates estimated in prisons from the same area but with different characteristics may differ significantly [46].	[[52, 54]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9731	Furthermore, the best available estimates of LTBI incidence in general population should be regarded cautiously, since they are not drawn from random samples of the population.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['LTBI']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9732	Meanwhile, information on factors potentially affecting the TST result interpretation such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin) status and nontuberculous mycobacteria distribution in the local population are not available..	[[60, 63]]	[]	['TST']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9733	The second is that the IRR for TB remains relatively constant over time; in fact, fluctuations of the IRR may occur within a decade or more [48]..	[[23, 26], [102, 105], [31, 33]]	[]	['IRR', 'IRR', 'TB']	[]	PMC3006353.nxml
9734	In conclusion, these findings provide a detailed summary of the evidence on LTBI and TB risk and incidence in prisons attributable to within-prison spread of TB and make it possible to estimate the impact at a population level.

9766	Nevertheless, provided that the introduction of LED-FM is accompanied by appropriate training and performance monitoring, LED-FM is an attractive potential tool for the laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis that, together with a move towards the collection of two on-the-spot smears in a single clinic visit, could ensure that poor patients have access to timely tuberculosis diagnosis and prompt treatment..

9767	The World Health Organization provides information on all aspects of tuberculosis, including information on tuberculosis diagnostics; recent WHO policy statements on diagnosis of tuberculosis are available; the Stop TB Partnership provides information on global tuberculosis control (some information in several languages).

9768	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem: there are 9.3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths per year [1], with 90% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1].	[[186, 190], [14, 16]]	[]	['LMIC', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9769	Most patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (PTB) in LMICs are investigated by examining three sputum specimens collected over a minimum of 2 d.	[[56, 60], [48, 51], [44, 46], [49, 51]]	[]	['LMIC', 'PTB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9770	Sputum smears are stained with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN), and each smear examination requires on average 5–10 min, creating considerable workloads for laboratories with limited resources.	[[46, 48]]	[]	['ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9771	An alternative technique to ZN smear microscopy, fluorescence microscopy (FM), is reported to be 10% more sensitive than ZN smear microscopy [2] and, since fluorescent acid fast bacilli (AFB) can be seen at lower magnification than ZN-stained AFB, FM smears can be examined in a fraction (about 25%) of the time needed for ZN smears [2].	[[187, 190], [243, 246], [74, 76], [248, 250], [28, 30], [121, 123], [232, 234], [323, 325]]	[[168, 185], [49, 72]]	['AFB', 'AFB', 'FM', 'FM', 'ZN', 'ZN', 'ZN', 'ZN']	['acid fast bacilli', 'fluorescence microscopy']	PMC3134458.nxml
9772	Although FM can reduce laboratory workloads [3], it has been difficult to implement it widely in LMICs due to the high cost and complexity of the microscope and mercury vapour lamp lighting system, the need for a dark room, and perceived health risks associated with ultraviolet light exposure [4]..	[[9, 11], [97, 101]]	[]	['FM', 'LMIC']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9773	These include the development of illumination systems based on LEDs (light-emitting diodes), which resulted in LED fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM) becoming commercially available [5].	[[144, 146], [140, 146]]	[[115, 138]]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	['fluorescence microscopy']	PMC3134458.nxml
9774	Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently modified its guidelines for the diagnosis of PTB [6] and reduced the number of AFB required to declare a smear as positive (from 10 to 1 AFB), the minimum number of specimens needed for diagnosis (from three to two), and the number of positive smears required to classify a patient as having smear-positive TB (from two to one smear).

9775	In a separate publication (also reported in PLoS Medicine [7]), we report that the ZN smear microscopy examination of two sputum specimens collected on the spot the first day of consultation, followed by the examination of a third specimen collected the following morning (i.e., spot-spot-morning [SSM]) identifies the same number of patients with smear-positive PTB as the frequently used spot-morning-spot (SMS) scheme (i.e., examination of one sputum specimen collected on the spot the first day of consultation, followed by the examination of a second specimen collected the following morning and a third specimen collected on the spot when the patient brings the morning specimen to the health centre) [8].

9776	As most smear-positive PTB patients are identified by the first two specimens [9], a SSM scheme could detect most smear-positive patients on the first day of consultation.	[[23, 26], [85, 88], [24, 26]]	[]	['PTB', 'SSM', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9777	It is thus conceivable that a service that examines SSM specimens using LED-FM and classifies patients using the revised WHO guidelines could ease workloads and speed up the diagnostic process in LMICs, with significant benefits for patients and health systems [3]..

9814	The number of cases of PTB continues to increase worldwide despite major international control initiatives [1], and at least 50 million individuals with chronic cough are screened for TB each year.	[[23, 26], [24, 26], [184, 186]]	[]	['PTB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9815	Although it is widely accepted that the early identification of cases through inexpensive point-of-care diagnostics is pivotal for effective control of TB, the diagnosis of PTB often relies on sputum smear microscopy, especially in resource-limited settings..	[[173, 176], [152, 154], [174, 176]]	[]	['PTB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9816	Sputum smear microscopy services are the most decentralized of the TB diagnostic services, allowing patients to be screened for tuberculosis at relatively basic health care facilities.	[[67, 69]]	[[128, 140]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3134458.nxml
9817	In most LMICs, however, these centres are less numerous than treatment centres, and many patients still need to travel to submit sputum specimens for diagnosis, incurring considerable personal costs, and this often leads patients to abandon the process.	[[8, 12]]	[]	['LMIC']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9818	The diagnosis of TB therefore is particularly difficult for poor and marginalised patients, who face multiple challenges to accessing a TB diagnosis [13], and the improvement of smear microscopy services remains necessary to increase patients' access to treatment [14].	[[17, 19], [136, 138]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9819	LED-FM holds multiple advantages over both the conventional mercury vapour lamp FM and standard light microscopy.	[[4, 6], [80, 82]]	[]	['FM', 'FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9820	The longer lifespan of the LED systems, as well as facilitating their implementation, may result in better quality FM than conventional systems since mercury vapour and halogen lamps are often used after their effective lifespan, with diminished power, to cause fluorescence.	[[115, 117]]	[]	['FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9821	The lower capital and maintenance costs of LED-based systems, the faster grading of smears than with ZN smear microscopy, and FM's reputed higher sensitivity makes LED-FM devices potentially more suitable for LMIC laboratories.	[[168, 170], [164, 170], [209, 213], [101, 103]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'LMIC', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9822	Despite this potential, there have been very few well-designed field evaluations using culture as the reference standard [2],[15] to assess whether LED-FM performance varies in locations with no or limited experience with FM..	[[152, 154], [222, 224], [148, 154]]	[]	['FM', 'FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9823	LED-FM in this study had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than ZN smear microscopy, which resulted in a significantly higher number of patients with PTB being treated, but lower overall diagnostic accuracy, as illustrated in Text S3.	[[4, 6], [157, 160], [158, 160], [71, 73]]	[]	['FM', 'PTB', 'TB', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9824	Although most previous studies are small [2],[15],[16], they have reported increased sensitivity and similar specificity of LED-FM compared with ZN smear microscopy.	[[128, 130], [124, 130], [145, 147]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9825	suggested that LED-FM had lower specificity than conventional ZN smear microscopy in patients co-infected with HIV in Uganda [17], suggesting that the loss of specificity was more evident in patients who had scanty AFB in sputum.	[[215, 218], [19, 21], [15, 21], [62, 64]]	[]	['AFB', 'FM', 'LED-FM', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9826	The investigators, however, had processed different specimens for ZN smear microscopy and FM; thus, the interpretation of this study is difficult [18], and further studies are needed.	[[90, 92], [66, 68]]	[]	['FM', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9827	There are real consequences to a false-positive result: patients incorrectly diagnosed with TB have the cost and inconvenience of taking a six-month course of treatment, and troublesome side effects are common, but life-threatening treatment-related events (hepatitis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) are infrequent (<5% incidence).	[[92, 94]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9828	The WHO manual for laboratory services in TB control states that the probability of obtaining a positive culture is related to the number of AFB in the specimen, with only about 50% of cultures of specimens with 1–2 AFB per 100 fields being identified as positive, increasing to 80% and 96.7% for specimens with “scanty” (1–9 AFB per 100 fields) and “+” AFB grades, respectively.	[[141, 144], [216, 219], [326, 329], [354, 357], [42, 44], [4, 7]]	[]	['AFB', 'AFB', 'AFB', 'AFB', 'TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9829	The analysis of our smear-positive, culture-negative results indicated that more than 98% of these were scanty smears with a median of one AFB per smear, and 23.7% had a second positive smear by either ZN smear microscopy or LED-FM.	[[139, 142], [202, 204]]	[]	['AFB', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9830	The “false positive” LED-FM results are thus most likely due to technician error, but we cannot discount the possibility that these were cases with TB or non-tuberculous mycobacteria with a false-negative solid medium result that would have been detected using liquid medium.	[[25, 27], [21, 27], [148, 150]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9831	There might also be cases of TB that would have been missed by both culture technologies (because of delayed processing/destruction of marginally viable bacilli during decontamination or bacterial overgrowth)..	[[29, 31]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9832	Clinical laboratories in our study had considerable experience with ZN smear microscopy but limited experience with mercury vapour lamp FM, and their conventional FM microscopes were neither functioning nor in recent use at the time of the study.	[[136, 138], [163, 165], [68, 70]]	[]	['FM', 'FM', 'ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9833	Although technicians received 2-d refresher training at the bench, were supervised for a further day to monitor performance, and had photographic bench-aids available, ZN smear microscopy had consistently higher specificity..	[[168, 170]]	[]	['ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9834	Interestingly, the rechecking of scanty smears and comparison against culture suggests that LED-FM also had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than conventional FM.	[[96, 98], [92, 98]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9835	These differences could have been due to the devices' performance characteristics, as reference laboratories are equipped with high-quality microscopes with greatly improved optics, and to the novelty of LED-FM, with laboratory technicians conducting more careful examinations and spending more time reading the smears to identify paucibacillary smears, while lacking experience to distinguish fluorescing artefacts from scanty AFB.	[[208, 210], [204, 210]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9836	Furthermore, technicians in the reference laboratories routinely use dark rooms, which facilitate visualizing the AFB in conventional FM but are not required with LED-FM, and may have been more cautious to declare smears with one or two bacilli as positive.	[[114, 117], [134, 136], [167, 169], [163, 169]]	[]	['AFB', 'FM', 'FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9837	Also, the smears may have faded, and AFB could have been washed off during re-staining..	[[37, 40]]	[]	['AFB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9838	Although the comparison of LED-FM and conventional FM was based on the verification of a partial selection of smears and needs to be replicated, national TB control programmes considering introducing LED-FM devices may wish to bear in mind that their performance could vary with the service setting, staff experience, and the type of devices used.	[[31, 33], [51, 53], [204, 206], [27, 33], [200, 206], [154, 156]]	[]	['FM', 'FM', 'FM', 'LED-FM', 'LED-FM', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9839	In contrast to the findings of this study, other studies conducted at established research centres have found similar specificity in conventional FM and LED-FM.	[[146, 148]]	[]	['FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9840	The LED-FM technology, however, is likely to be widely implemented, and the study still gives valuable insights into operational issues.	[[8, 10], [4, 10]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9841	The performance of LED-FM, and indeed any diagnostic test, depends critically on proficiency of test operators.	[[23, 25], [19, 25]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9842	Current expert opinion is that only moderate training (3 d) is required to make laboratory technicians already proficient in ZN smear microscopy proficient in LED-FM.	[[125, 127]]	[]	['ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9843	The introduction of LED-FM therefore needs to be accompanied by careful training, appropriate quality control, and monitoring of the performance of LED-FM in the field.	[[24, 26], [152, 154], [20, 26], [148, 154]]	[]	['FM', 'FM', 'LED-FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9844	The study also indicates that the sensitivity and specificity of LED-FM is independent of whether the sputum specimens are collected as SSM or SMS.	[[69, 71], [65, 71], [136, 139]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9845	There is hardly any evidence that a particular sequence of sputum collection increases the probability of finding TB bacilli, and we have recently demonstrated that this is not so [7].	[[114, 116]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9846	SMS requires that all patients return to provide the morning sample, while the SSM would identify most smear-positive cases in one day.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['SSM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9847	The WHO has recently recommended using spot specimens (indeed spot-spot) to allow the screening of patients in one day.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9848	However, the change in policy was based on the evaluation of the method using ZN smear microscopy.	[[78, 80]]	[]	['ZN']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9849	We now provide evidence that a frontloaded LED-FM approach that uses two spot specimens results in the same yield as approaches using a conventional SMS LED-FM scheme.	[[47, 49], [157, 159], [43, 49], [153, 159], [149, 152]]	[]	['FM', 'FM', 'LED-FM', 'LED-FM', 'SMS']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9850	Moreover, it is important to consider the role that LED-FM can play in the recent WHO endorsement of the new rapid, automated nucleic acid amplification test, Xpert.	[[56, 58], [52, 58], [82, 85]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9851	It is unlikely, in the short term, that Xpert can be scaled up and decentralized sufficiently to replace smear microscopy as the initial diagnostic test worldwide, even in areas with high rates of multi-drug-resistant TB or HIV-associated TB, where Xpert is recommended as the initial screening test.	[[218, 220], [239, 241]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9852	Furthermore, the WHO recommends continuing to use smear microscopy for treatment monitoring, even in areas served by new technologies such as TB culture, line probe assays, and the Xpert assay.	[[142, 144], [17, 20]]	[]	['TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9853	In areas without high rates of multi-drug-resistant TB or HIV-associated TB, cost-effectiveness considerations favour the use of smear microscopy as the initial diagnostic tool, and thus the improved performance of direct smear microscopy (and indeed a technique that facilitates faster examination of smears) is an important step for improving diagnostic services in LMICs, one that would reduce laboratory workloads and facilitate the faster identification of patients with negative smear microscopy who could undergo further tests..	[[368, 372], [52, 54], [73, 75]]	[]	['LMIC', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9854	Despite the reduced specificity of LED-FM, this approach still has operational advantages that make it an attractive tool for TB laboratory diagnosis.	[[39, 41], [35, 41], [126, 128]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9855	National control programmes introducing new LED-FM services should monitor the performance of the method under operational conditions, as training needs of staff may be greater than anticipated.	[[48, 50], [44, 50]]	[]	['FM', 'LED-FM']	[]	PMC3134458.nxml
9856	This study has shown that LED-FM can play a key role in reaching WHO targets for TB detection, reducing laboratory workloads, and ensuring poor patients' access to TB diagnosis and prompt treatment..

9863	This clinical trial of adults with cough ≥2 wk duration (in Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, and Yemen) compared the sensitivity/specificity of two sputum samples collected “on the spot” during the first visit plus one sputum sample collected the following morning (spot-spot-morning [SSM]) versus the standard spot-morning-spot (SMS) scheme.	[[323, 326]]	[[304, 321]]	['SMS']	['spot-morning-spot']	PMC3134460.nxml

9865	In total, 6,627 patients (3,052 SSM/3,575 SMS) were enrolled; 6,466 had culture and 1,526 were culture-positive.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['SMS']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9866	The sensitivity of SSM (ITT, 70.2%, 95% CI 66.5%–73.9%) was non-inferior to the sensitivity of SMS (PPA, 65.9%, 95% CI 62.3%–69.5%).	[[24, 27], [100, 103], [20, 22], [95, 98], [19, 22]]	[]	['ITT', 'PPA', 'SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9867	Similarly, the specificity of SSM (ITT, 96.9%, 95% CI 93.2%–99.9%) was non-inferior to the specificity of SMS (ITT, 97.6%, 95% CI 94.0%–99.9%).	[[35, 38], [111, 114], [31, 33], [106, 109], [30, 33]]	[]	['ITT', 'ITT', 'SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9868	The sensitivity of spot-spot (ITT, 63.6%, 95% CI 59.7%–67.5%) was also non-inferior to spot-morning (ITT, 64.8%, 95% CI 61.3%–68.3%), as the difference was within the selected −5% non-inferiority limit (difference ITT = 1.4%, 95% CI −3.7% to 6.6%).	[[30, 33], [101, 104]]	[]	['ITT', 'ITT']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9869	Patients screened using the SSM scheme were more likely to provide the first two specimens than patients screened with the SMS scheme (98% versus 94.2%, p<0.01).	[[29, 31], [123, 126], [28, 31]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9870	The PPA and ITT analysis resulted in similar results..	[[12, 15], [4, 7]]	[]	['ITT', 'PPA']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9871	The sensitivity and specificity of SSM are non-inferior to those of SMS, with a higher proportion of patients submitting specimens.	[[36, 38], [68, 71], [35, 38]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9872	In most national tuberculosis control programs, patients provide an “on the spot” specimen during their initial consultation, a specimen collected at home the next morning, and another on-the-spot specimen when they bring their morning specimen to the clinic (a “spot-morning-spot,” or SMS, collection scheme).	[[286, 289]]	[[263, 280]]	['SMS']	['spot-morning-spot']	PMC3134460.nxml
9873	In this non-inferiority, cluster randomized trial, the researchers compare the sensitivity and specificity of a spot-spot-morning (SSM; two on-the-spot specimens collected during the first clinic visit an hour apart, and a third specimen collected at home the next morning) scheme for tuberculosis diagnosis with those of the standard SMS scheme.	[[132, 134], [335, 338], [131, 134]]	[[117, 129], [112, 129]]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	['spot-morning', 'spot-spot-morning']	PMC3134460.nxml
9874	The centers participating in the study were randomly assigned each week for a year to use either the SMS or the SSM sample collection scheme.	[[113, 115], [101, 104], [112, 115]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9875	Compared to mycobacterial culture, the sensitivities of the SSM and SMS schemes were 70.2% and 65.9%, respectively, which indicates that the new scheme was non-inferior to the SMS scheme.	[[61, 63], [68, 71], [176, 179], [60, 63]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9876	Similarly, the specificity of SSM (96.9%) was non-inferior to that of SMS (97.6%).	[[31, 33], [70, 73], [30, 33]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9877	Importantly, the sensitivity of diagnosis using just the first two samples collected in the SSM scheme was also non-inferior to the sensitivity of diagnosis using the first two samples collected in the SMS scheme (63.6% versus 64.8%; the researchers defined non-inferiority of SSM as a difference in its sensitivity compared to that of SMS of less than −5%).	[[93, 95], [278, 280], [202, 205], [336, 339], [92, 95], [277, 280]]	[]	['SM', 'SM', 'SMS', 'SMS', 'SSM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9878	Finally, patients tested using the SSM scheme were more likely to provide the first two samples than patients tested using the SMS scheme (98% versus 94.2%)..	[[36, 38], [127, 130], [35, 38]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9879	These findings suggest that a sputum collection scheme in which two samples are collected one hour apart followed by a morning specimen could identify as many smear-positive patients as the standard SMS scheme.	[[199, 202]]	[]	['SMS']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9880	These findings suggest that the SSM scheme might be more suitable for tuberculosis diagnosis than the SMS scheme in locations where patients are likely to drop out of the diagnosis process (for example, in low- and middle-income countries, where patients often live a long way from clinics).	[[33, 35], [102, 105], [32, 35]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9881	However, for an SSM scheme to work effectively, an on-site laboratory with a same-day turn-around service will be essential, and tuberculosis clinics will need to minimize contact between patients waiting to provide their second on-the-spot specimen..	[[17, 19], [16, 19]]	[]	['SM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9882	The World Health Organization provides information on all aspects of tuberculosis, including information on tuberculosis diagnostics and on the recommendation to reduce the number of smears for diagnosis to two; the Stop TB Partnership provides information on global tuberculosis control (some information in several languages).	[[221, 223]]	[[69, 81], [108, 120], [267, 279]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis', 'tuberculosis', 'tuberculosis']	PMC3134460.nxml
9883	Nine million people developed tuberculosis (TB) and 1.7 million died from the disease in 2008 [1], with over 90% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1].	[[169, 174], [44, 46]]	[[135, 167], [30, 42]]	['LMICs', 'TB']	['low- and middle-income countries', 'tuberculosis']	PMC3134460.nxml
9884	Most patients in LMICs are investigated by direct sputum smear microscopy, which, although widely available, has low sensitivity [2] and requires the examination of multiple specimens over several days to maximise the identification of cases [3],[4].	[[17, 22]]	[]	['LMICs']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9885	Most national TB programmes (NTPs) collect specimens using a spot-morning-spot (SMS) scheme, whereby patients provide one “on the spot” specimen at the time of consultation, one specimen produced at home the morning of the following day, and a third specimen on the spot when the patient brings the morning specimen to the service.

9886	Thus, given the excessive workloads of many laboratories in LMICs, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a reduction (from three to two) of the number of specimens examined under certain circumstances [10],[11].	[[60, 65], [98, 101]]	[]	['LMICs', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9887	Andrews and colleagues' study had reported that the yield of the three specimens was independent of the order in which these specimens were collected [5], and a scheme collecting three specimens as spot-spot-morning (SSM) has recently been reported to result in the same yield as the standard SMS scheme [12].

9888	Schemes that collect specimens in an accelerated fashion may have the potential to improve diagnostic services in LMICs by reducing the number of visits and the number of patients defaulting [15]–[17].	[[114, 119]]	[]	['LMICs']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml

9931	Using the ITT parameters, three specimens collected with the SSM and SMS schemes would result in 90.4% and 90.0% of patients, respectively, being correctly classified, while the SS and SM smears would result in 89.2% and 89.8% of patients, respectively, being correctly classified.

9935	Smear microscopy thus remains the test most widely used for diagnosis in LMICs..	[[73, 78]]	[]	['LMICs']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9936	Between 70% and 90% of these examinations take place in 22 high-TB burden countries [21], where 60% of the population lives on less than US$2.00/day.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9937	Furthermore, between 5% (e.g., Pakistan [22]) and 52% (e.g., Cape Town, South Africa [23]) of cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB default the diagnostic process after submission of the first specimen [22]–[27].	[[130, 132]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9938	Currently, most patients requested to provide SMS specimens receive the results of all sputum examinations the next day of consultation, or later.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['SMS']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9939	Even so, participants in the SSM arm were more likely to submit their first two sputum samples compared to participants in the SMS arm, and the scheme could be implemented in a way that allows patients to return later in the day to receive laboratory results and referral for treatment.	[[30, 32], [127, 130], [29, 32]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9940	The SSM scheme has sensitivity and specificity that is not-inferior to the SMS scheme used in most LMICs.	[[5, 7], [75, 78], [4, 7]]	[]	['SM', 'SMS', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9941	Similarly, the two-specimen SS scheme sensitivity was not inferior to that of the two-specimen SM scheme, and the losses in sensitivity from the three- to the two-specimen scheme are within the range predicted by a systematic review (0%–10% losses) [9].	[[95, 97], [28, 30]]	[]	['SM', 'SS']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9942	Using two spot specimens in this study resulted in up to 7% lower sensitivity than using the SSM scheme.	[[94, 96], [93, 96]]	[]	['SM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9943	NTPs with overburdened laboratories that screen patients following the WHO recommendation of examining two smears [28] thus could consider collecting two on-the-spot specimens if a significant proportion of patients default from the diagnostic process, as the lower drop-out in patient numbers would at least compensate for the loss in sensitivity.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9944	In addition, programmes that decided to continue collecting three specimens could use a SSM scheme and identify most smear-positive cases the first day of consultation.	[[89, 91], [88, 91]]	[]	['SM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9945	The WHO-endorsed Xpert tests (Cepheid) are likely to be used mostly in patients with negative smear microscopy, and the rapid screening of patients that require further testing would be key for avoiding delays in the diagnostic process..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9946	Despite these limitations, the strikingly similar differences in sensitivity and specificity observed under the ITT analysis and PPA strengthen the conclusions that can be drawn from the findings..	[[112, 115], [129, 132]]	[]	['ITT', 'PPA']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9947	Patients with severe TB symptoms were more likely to take up HIV testing than patients with milder clinical presentation; thus, patients accepting these tests in Ethiopia and Nigeria may have had more advanced stages of TB.	[[21, 23]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9948	This would be specially challenging in rural and remote areas and primary health care clinics where potential TB patients may find it hardest to access clinics and where capacity to undertake smear examinations may not be available on site.	[[110, 112]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9949	The implementation of a SSM scheme would therefore require changes to the provision of services, including on-site laboratory with a same-day turn-around time, services that enable the initiation or referral of patients for treatment at the time that results become available, and, in high HIV prevalence areas, services to minimize contact between patients, and thus minimize the risk of nosocomial infection, by collecting the first specimen during the triage stage, collecting the second specimen one hour later, and asking the patient to return to the clinic in the afternoon..	[[25, 27], [24, 27]]	[]	['SM', 'SSM']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9950	In summary, a scheme consisting of two smears collected one hour apart followed by a morning specimen identifies as many smear-positive patients as the standard SMS scheme, and patients were more likely to submit the first two specimens.	[[161, 164]]	[]	['SMS']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml
9951	The identification of the majority of smear-positive patients may require no more than one patient visit, and the scheme presented here has the potential to improve the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in LMICs [16].	[[198, 203], [192, 194]]	[]	['LMICs', 'TB']	[]	PMC3134460.nxml

9972	Finally, sensitivity analyses (reruns of the decision-analysis model using different values for test costs and accuracy) identified no scenario in which serology was either less costly or more effective than sputum smear microscopy alone or in which serology plus sputum microscopy was more cost-effective than MGIT culture plus sputum microscopy..

9973	Moreover, they suggest that in areas where high-quality microscopy is available, resources are sufficient, and infrastructure to effectively use culture exists, the addition of MGIT culture to sputum smear microscopy would be more cost-effective than the addition of serology.	[[177, 181]]	[]	['MGIT']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9974	Importantly, these findings suggest that, if used as an initial test for tuberculosis in India, serology would result in more DALYs, more secondary infections, and more false-positive diagnoses than sputum smear microscopy while increasing per-patient costs to the Indian tuberculosis control sector.

9977	The Evidence-based TB Diagnosis Web site by the Stop TB Partnership's New Diagnostics Working Group provides evidence syntheses on various TB tests, along with guidelines, resources, and training materials.	[[19, 21], [53, 55], [139, 141]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9978	Improved diagnostic testing represents a key component of tuberculosis (TB) control [1]–[3], and inadequate case detection is a major hurdle for effective control of the TB epidemic.	[[72, 74], [170, 172]]	[[58, 70]]	['TB', 'TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3153451.nxml
9979	Sputum smear microscopy, the current backbone of TB diagnosis worldwide, misses 50% of all cases and is often performed under suboptimal laboratory conditions [4]–[6].	[[49, 51]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9980	Thus, if targets for TB control are to be achieved, newer diagnostic tools for active TB must be used.	[[21, 23], [86, 88]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9981	On the basis of available evidence [7],[8], the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends several technologies for TB diagnosis [9], including culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using commercial liquid media (e.g., mycobacteria growth indicator tube [MGIT], BD Diagnostics) or noncommercial methods (e.g., microscopic observation drug susceptibility [MODS]), and more recently, rapid molecular testing with the Xpert MTB/RIF system (Cepheid, Inc.) [10],[11].	[[126, 128], [75, 78]]	[[179, 191]]	['TB', 'WHO']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3153451.nxml
9982	However, TB culture often takes weeks to obtain results, and all currently recommended diagnostic tests (other than microscopy) require infrastructure currently unavailable in many settings [7],[8],[12].	[[9, 11]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9983	Before investing in additional infrastructure, it is important to assess whether other, more immediately accessible, TB diagnostic tests might be cost-effective..	[[117, 119]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9984	Serological tests for active TB are based on detection of antibodies elicited by antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are recognized by the humoral immune system.	[[29, 31]]	[[107, 119]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3153451.nxml
9985	Although no international guideline recommends their use, serological tests for active TB are readily available and widely used in parts of the developing world, including India and at least 16 of 21 other high-burden countries [15].	[[87, 89]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9986	Thus, while unlikely to be as accurate as TB culture, serological tests might still be preferred over sputum smear microscopy, and serology might also be economically attractive relative to culture and molecular tests given fewer infrastructure requirements, faster turnaround time, and higher volume of usage..	[[42, 44]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9987	The economic implications of serological testing for TB are substantial.	[[53, 55]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9988	In India, at least 13 different TB serological kits are on the market (Table 1), and an estimated 1.5 million serological tests for active TB are performed every year (primarily in the private medical sector), at a cost of over US$15 million for testing alone [15],[16].	[[32, 34], [139, 141]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9989	To better understand the economic and epidemiological consequences of serological testing for active TB in India, we analyzed costs and effectiveness from the perspective of the combined public and private TB control sector of the health care system..	[[101, 103], [206, 208]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml

9993	Thus, this cohort provides a conservative estimate of costs and outcomes among all Indian patients receiving serological testing for active TB in a given year.	[[140, 142]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml

9998	In the second stage, we sought to evaluate the optimal diagnostic strategy for improved TB diagnosis in settings where sputum smear microscopy is routinely performed.	[[88, 90]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
9999	The baseline scenario for the first analysis assumed that the study population receives the combination of tests (e.g., chest X-ray [CXR]) and clinical strategies (e.g., antibiotic trials) that is typical in India, with the exception of using no TB-specific microbiological test (including sputum smear microscopy, culture, or serology).	[[246, 248]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10000	We assumed that the country-wide smear-negative TB case detection rate in India approximates the ability of clinicians to successfully diagnose TB in this situation.	[[48, 50], [144, 146]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10001	To evaluate the most appropriate initial test for TB in this situation, we modeled the addition to the baseline scenario of sputum smear microscopy versus serological testing using anda-tb ELISA (Anda Biologicals; the most widely studied and used serological test in India) [14].	[[50, 52]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10002	Serology is primarily available in India through stand-alone and large network (chain) private laboratories which also offer TB cultures.	[[125, 127]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10003	Thus, we assumed that the population had existing access to serology (at market prices), and that similar access to TB culture could be established by constructing an appropriate laboratory facility; there are currently 27 reference laboratories capable of culture and drug-susceptibility testing, accredited by the Indian Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP).	[[362, 367], [116, 118], [340, 342]]	[]	['RNTCP', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10004	We assumed that sputum smear and serology could be performed by send-out testing to a public or private laboratory with a 1-wk turnaround time, and that TB culture would incur additional delays of 8 wk for specimen incubation, reporting of results, and initiation of treatment [20].	[[153, 155]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10005	Regarding costs, we conservatively estimated that anda-TB would cost US$20 per person with suspected active TB on the basis of data from private labs in India [15],[16], although the total cost per patient often exceeds US$40 (because three antibodies—IgA, IgG, and IgM—are often requested).	[[55, 57], [108, 110]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10006	We assumed that the cost per TB culture was US$20, approximately equal to the cost of automated MGIT culture, including the costs of laboratory construction and overheads, when run at half-maximum throughput in Zambia [21].	[[96, 100], [29, 31]]	[]	['MGIT', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10007	Patients diagnosed with TB were assumed to be treated according to RNTCP national standards..	[[67, 72], [24, 26]]	[]	['RNTCP', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10008	For TB serology, we used the sensitivity and specificity of anda-TB, the most widely studied test according to a recently updated meta-analysis [14].	[[4, 6], [65, 67]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10009	Since anda-TB is likely to outperform more poorly studied in-house serological tests and less accurate rapid test formats [14], and laboratory accuracy is likely to exceed that in the field, our analysis likely overestimates the accuracy of serology as actually performed in practice.	[[11, 13]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10010	We assumed that all incremental costs and effects of TB treatment occur during the first year after presentation with symptoms of active TB (i.e., that any patient who would be successfully diagnosed with TB would be diagnosed within 1 y of presentation).	[[53, 55], [137, 139], [205, 207]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10011	Patients with active TB at the end of this year are assumed to remain infectious for an additional year [24], acknowledging that the period of infectivity depends on numerous variables including HIV status, age, gender, and type (e.g., cavitary nature) of disease.	[[21, 23]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10012	We lack reliable data on the costs of hospitalization for TB, lost wages due to TB, or treatment for other related conditions (e.g., bacterial pneumonia).	[[58, 60], [80, 82]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10013	Thus, we adopted the perspective of the Indian TB control sector, including both the public RNTCP and those elements of the private health care sector devoted to diagnosis and treatment of TB.	[[92, 97], [47, 49]]	[]	['RNTCP', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10014	Our primary outcome was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted.	[[80, 84]]	[[49, 78]]	['DALY']	['disability-adjusted life year']	PMC3153451.nxml
10015	We discounted all future costs and effects (DALYs and secondary TB transmissions) by 3% per year, with sensitivity analysis for 0% and 7%..	[[44, 48], [64, 66]]	[]	['DALY', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10016	The hypothetical study population of 1.5 million adults with suspected active TB included an estimated 214,000 cases of active TB, or 16% of India's annual burden of incident TB [26].	[[78, 80], [127, 129], [175, 177]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10017	We estimated that, in the absence of TB-specific microbiological testing (i.e., in the baseline scenario), clinicians would diagnose 114,000 (53%) of these patients with TB on the basis of clinical judgment and nonmicrobiological tests (e.g., chest X-ray [CXR], antibiotic therapeutic trials) alone.	[[37, 39], [170, 172]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10018	Addition of sputum smear microscopy to this scenario of no TB-specific testing resulted in diagnosis of an estimated 44,000 more cases of TB, or 44% of remaining undiagnosed cases (Table 3).	[[59, 61], [138, 140]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10019	Replacing sputum smear with serological testing resulted in an estimated 14,000 more diagnosed cases of TB than did sputum smear, but also resulted in 121,000 additional false-positive diagnoses relative to microscopy.	[[104, 106]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10020	Because the cases detected by sputum smear are assumed to be more infectious than those detected by serology, smear was estimated to avert 102,000 more DALYs and 32,000 more secondary cases than did serology, at approximately one-fourth the incremental cost.	[[152, 156]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10021	If performed only on smear-negative specimens, TB culture was both cheaper and more effective (i.e., dominant) compared with serological testing (Table 3).	[[47, 49]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10022	For each additional smear-negative TB case diagnosed by serology, more than six additional false positives were inappropriately diagnosed..	[[35, 37]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10023	When we conducted one-way sensitivity analysis of all variables across the ranges specified in Table 2, no scenario was identified in which serology was either less costly or more effective than sputum smear microscopy alone, nor serology plus sputum smear more cost-effective than MGIT culture plus sputum smear.	[[282, 286]]	[]	['MGIT']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10024	By contrast, the influence of specificity on the cost-effectiveness of sputum smear was small (incremental cost per DALY averted of US$19 versus US$14 for sputum smear specificity of 97% versus 100%).	[[116, 120]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10025	Thus, comparing serology alone to sputum smear, we performed two-way sensitivity analysis around sensitivity and specificity of serology, plus three-way sensitivity analysis sequentially incorporating the price of serology and proportion of TB cases presenting with smear-positive TB.	[[241, 243]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10026	For serological testing to achieve equivalent effectiveness (in terms of DALYs averted) to sputum smear microscopy, sensitivity for both smear-positive and smear-negative TB would be required to exceed 81%–86%, depending on specificity (Figure 2A).	[[73, 77], [171, 173]]	[]	['DALY', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10027	These thresholds are less stringent in settings where a lower proportion of TB patients present with smear-positive disease (Figure 2B).	[[76, 78]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10028	Because of the excess cost of treating false positives, serology (with any sensitivity) would need to achieve a specificity of >0.92 before a test, even with a price of US$0.01, could be less costly to the TB control sector than sputum smear.	[[206, 208]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10029	When we evaluated the lower bounds of published values for the specificity (0.74) and smear-positive sensitivity (0.63) of serological testing to compensate for possible publication bias, serology was estimated to avert 171,000 fewer DALYs and cost US$48.1 million more than sputum smear microscopy alone.	[[234, 238]]	[]	['DALY']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10030	When added to sputum smear microscopy, serology would need to achieve exceptional sensitivity and specificity (e.g., 70% sensitivity and 97% specificity for smear-negative TB) to achieve more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios than TB culture (Figure 3)..	[[172, 174], [233, 235]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10031	Specificity and sensitivity (for smear-positive and smear-negative TB) would be required to achieve values above the primary line for serology to be more effective than sputum smear microscopy alone.	[[67, 69]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10032	The vertical and horizontal lines denote the 95% credible intervals of estimated accuracy from published studies of anda-TB [14], the most widely used serological test in India.	[[121, 123]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10033	(A) compares serology alone against sputum smear microscopy alone in a setting where 53% of TB patients are smear-positive (base case scenario), while (B) considers a scenario in which only 40% of TB patients are smear-positive..	[[92, 94], [197, 199]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10034	For the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to be more favorable for serology than for TB culture using commercial liquid media (MGIT) in the base-case scenario (73% sensitivity and 99% specificity), the sensitivity and specificity of serology for smear-negative TB must achieve values above the primary line.	[[137, 141], [95, 97], [271, 273]]	[]	['MGIT', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10035	This study, in a hypothetical cohort of 1.5 million adult Indian persons with suspected active TB, suggests that sputum smear microscopy remains the most cost-effective initial diagnostic test for active TB, across a wide range of plausible parameter estimates.	[[95, 97], [204, 206]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10036	In areas where quality-assured microscopy is already available and resources are sufficient, liquid TB culture is a more cost-effective addition than serology.	[[100, 102]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10037	As an addition to sputum smear plus clinical judgment, serology detects more than six false positives for every new smear-negative TB case appropriately diagnosed, and from the economic perspective of the Indian TB control sector, is less favorable than (i.e., dominated by) other diagnostic options..	[[131, 133], [212, 214]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10038	This study highlights the substantial adverse economic consequences of serological TB testing in India.	[[83, 85]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10039	Although most serological testing in India is performed in the private sector, patients diagnosed with TB (including false positives) are often sent for treatment in public facilities [27].	[[103, 105]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10040	The scale-up of the RNTCP is estimated to have added over US$88 billion in economic benefit to India over the last 10 y through country-wide implementation of directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS) services, including sputum smear microscopy [28].	[[20, 25]]	[]	['RNTCP']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10041	Given the scale of the RNTCP's activities and its limited budget, any diagnostic strategy demanding additional resources may divert those resources from further improvement of sputum smear microscopy or engagement of the private sector to provide broader access to microscopy or other new WHO-endorsed diagnostics.	[[289, 292]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10042	If serology is used as a replacement for sputum smear microscopy in one-third of the estimated 1.5 million patients receiving serologic TB diagnosis annually in India [16], we estimate that the Indian TB control sector would lose an estimated US$11.9 million (approximately one-sixth the annual budget of the RNTCP) [16], generate 11,000 additional secondary cases of TB (nearly 1% of all incident TB cases in India) [26], treat 40,000 false-positive patients unnecessarily, and cause 34,000 DALYs..

10043	Although we designed this analysis primarily as an evaluation of serological testing, our secondary results regarding TB culture suggest that, from the perspective of the Indian TB control sector, MGIT would be cost-effective, assuming that systems could be put in place to translate culture results consistently into treatment decisions [20].	[[197, 201], [118, 120], [178, 180]]	[]	['MGIT', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10044	While there is no universal standard for cost-effectiveness of interventions, those whose cost per DALY averted is less than a country's per-capita gross domestic product (GDP, US$3,100 in India [29]) are considered by the Commission for Macroeconomics and Health and WHO to be “very cost-effective” [30].	[[99, 103], [268, 271]]	[]	['DALY', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10045	Sputum smear microscopy is estimated to cost US$19 per DALY averted, and addition of TB culture to sputum smear US$213 per DALY averted, speaking to the importance of efforts to increase India's TB control budget and to deploy TB diagnostics in settings where current diagnostic standards are poor [17].	[[55, 59], [123, 127], [85, 87], [195, 197], [227, 229]]	[]	['DALY', 'DALY', 'TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10046	Indeed, the RNTCP will require substantially higher resources to scale-up improved and new TB diagnostics in India, as it begins a new phase (2012–2017)..	[[12, 17], [91, 93]]	[]	['RNTCP', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10047	One important, and often overlooked, consideration in cost-effectiveness analyses of TB diagnostics is the role of false-positive results [31].	[[85, 87]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10048	Most prior cost-effectiveness analyses of TB diagnostics (e.g., [3],[17]) have focused on the importance of high sensitivity in controlling the TB epidemic, assessing small costs (e.g., the cost of first-line TB drugs) to patients incorrectly diagnosed with TB.	[[42, 44], [144, 146], [209, 211]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10049	However, in a setting where a diagnostic test could result in over six times as many incremental false-positive as true-positive diagnoses (Table 3), other considerations including loss of faith in the health care system, ethical concerns of physicians, and adverse effects of TB therapy may be increasingly relevant.	[[277, 279]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10050	Furthermore, we assumed a setting where one in seven persons with suspected TB has active disease; where this ratio is lower, low-specificity diagnostics will perform even more poorly.	[[76, 78]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10051	Thus, our analysis may be biased against those diagnostics (i.e., smear and TB culture) with highest specificity..	[[76, 78]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10052	Nevertheless, we were unable to generate a model in which serology was more effective than sputum smear or more cost-effective than TB culture despite variation of each individual parameter by at least 25% of its baseline value.	[[132, 134]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10053	For example, a total of 686 patients (105 from developing countries) have been reported in the published literature for anda-TB: the most widely studied serological test, available since 1990 [14].	[[125, 127]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10054	This number compares with 1,730 patients reported in the first publication of Xpert MTB/RIF, a novel molecular test for TB [10], and over 14,000 specimens evaluated by MGIT [23].	[[168, 172], [120, 122]]	[]	['MGIT', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10055	First, we were unable to adopt a societal perspective, owing to the lack of reliable data on the societal costs of TB diagnosis and treatment in India.	[[115, 117]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10056	Thus, while internally consistent, our analysis should not be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of improved TB diagnostics to interventions in other areas of the health care sector.	[[113, 115]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10057	Our estimate of the cost-effectiveness of sputum smear microscopy plus TB treatment (US$19 per DALY averted) is nonetheless similar to that of the World Bank (US$7–US$11 in 2010 dollars for a low-income country) [33].	[[95, 99], [71, 73]]	[]	['DALY', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10058	Second, since our primary focus was on serology, we limited our analysis to drug-sensitive TB and did not conduct a full costing study for culture.	[[91, 93]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10059	Finally, although we estimated secondary transmissions from our primary cohort, our model has a static 1-y analysis frame and does not account for changes over time including repeated rounds of TB transmission.	[[194, 196]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10060	We may therefore underestimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of improved TB diagnosis [34]..	[[76, 78]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10061	These data were presented to a WHO Expert Group that met in July 2010 to review the evidence on TB serological assays.	[[96, 98], [31, 34]]	[]	['TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10062	Based on the Expert Group's recommendation, in July 2011, the WHO published a policy statement on commercial serodiagnostic tests for diagnosis of TB.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10063	It is therefore recommended that these tests should not be used in individuals suspected of active pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB, irrespective of their HIV status.	[[128, 130]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10064	The WHO policy strongly encourages targeted further research to identify new/alternative point-ofcare tests for TB diagnosis and/or serological tests with improved accuracy [34],[35,45]..	[[112, 114], [4, 7]]	[]	['TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153451.nxml
10065	In conclusion, this cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that, as an initial test for active TB among adults in India, serology results in more DALYs, secondary infections, and false-positive diagnoses than sputum smear microscopy, while increasing per-patient costs to the Indian TB control sector.

10075	As part of a World Health Organization policy process, we performed an updated systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of commercial serological tests for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB with a focus on the relevance of these tests in low- and middle-income countries..	[[196, 198]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10076	For pulmonary TB, we included 67 studies (48% from low- and middle-income countries) with 5,147 participants.	[[14, 16]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10077	For anda-TB IgG, the only test with enough studies for meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 63%–87%) in smear-positive (seven studies) and 59% (95% CI 10%–96%) in smear-negative (four studies) patients; pooled specificities were 92% (95% CI 74%–98%) and 91% (95% CI 79%–96%), respectively.	[[9, 11]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10078	Compared with ELISA (pooled sensitivity 60% [95% CI 6%–65%]; pooled specificity 98% [95% CI 96%–99%]), immunochromatographic tests yielded lower pooled sensitivity (53%, 95% CI 42%–64%) and comparable pooled specificity (98%, 95% CI 94%–99%).	[[14, 19]]	[]	['ELISA']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10079	For extrapulmonary TB, we included 25 studies (40% from low- and middle-income countries) with 1,809 participants.	[[19, 21]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10080	Overall, quality of evidence was graded very low for studies of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB..	[[93, 95]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10081	For the anda-TB IgG test—the only test with sufficient studies for a meta-analysis—the pooled sensitivity from the relevant studies was 76% in smear-positive patients and 59% in smear-negative patients.	[[13, 15]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10082	For now, though, based on these findings, cost-effectiveness data, and expert opinion, the World Health Organization has issued a recommendation against the use of currently available serological tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, while stressing the importance of continued research on these and other tests that could provide quick and accurate diagnosis of TB..

[[62, 64], [150, 152]]	[[28, 40]]	['TB', 'TB']	['tuberculosis']	PMC3153457.nxml
10085	Despite impressive advances in tuberculosis (TB) control over the last decade [1], missed diagnoses continue to fuel the global epidemic, leading to more severe illness for patients and enabling further transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2].	[[45, 47]]	[[31, 43], [233, 245]]	['TB']	['tuberculosis', 'tuberculosis']	PMC3153457.nxml
10086	Smear microscopy and chest radiography, the primary tools used in resource-limited countries for identifying TB, often perform poorly, especially in HIV-coinfected patients [3]–[5].	[[109, 111]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10087	The Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid), a new technology recently endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), provides high sensitivity for detection of TB and drug resistance [6].	[[147, 149], [98, 101]]	[]	['TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10088	In comparison with microscopy, serological tests appear to offer several advantages: (1) the result from a serological test using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format could be available within hours, and the result using an immunochromatographic assay format, within minutes; (2) a serological test, if developed into a point-of-care test, could potentially replace microscopy or extend testing to lower levels of health services; and (3) in children, for whom sputum is difficult to obtain, and in patients suspected of having extrapulmonary TB, a blood test may be more practical..	[[169, 174], [559, 561]]	[[134, 167]]	['ELISA', 'TB']	['enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay']	PMC3153457.nxml
10089	Although currently the International Standards for TB Care discourages the use of serological tests in routine practice [8] and no international guideline recommends their use, dozens of commercial serological tests for TB diagnosis are offered for sale in many parts of the world [9], including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and Viet Nam, as was recently found in a survey of 22 high TB burden countries [10].	[[51, 53], [220, 222], [511, 513]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10090	Two subsequent reviews evaluating commercial serological tests for pulmonary TB (68 studies) [12] and extrapulmonary TB (21 studies) [13] found the sensitivity and specificity of these tests to be highly variable.	[[77, 79], [117, 119]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10091	The fourth review, a meta-analysis of in-house serological tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB (254 studies including 51 distinct single antigens and 30 distinct multiple-antigen combinations), identified potential candidate antigens for inclusion in an antibody-detection-based TB test in patients with and without HIV infection; however, no single antigen achieved sufficient sensitivity to replace smear microscopy [14].	[[96, 98], [283, 285]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10092	A laboratory-based evaluation of 19 rapid commercial tests conducted by the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases found that, in comparison with culture plus clinical follow-up, serological tests provided low and variable sensitivity (1% to 60%) and specificity (53% to 99%) [15]..	[[76, 79]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10093	This updated systematic review was commissioned by WHO to guide policy recommendations on serological tests for TB, with a special focus on the relevance of these assays in low- and middle-income countries.	[[112, 114], [51, 54]]	[]	['TB', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10094	The objective of this review is to synthesize new evidence since 2006 in order to address the following question: what is the diagnostic accuracy of commercial serological tests for active TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB) in adults and children, with and without HIV infection? Specifically, we were interested in evaluating the use of a serological assay as a replacement test for, or an additional test after, smear microscopy..	[[189, 191], [222, 224]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10095	Diagnostic studies (with any study design) were included that evaluated serological tests for active TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB) in patients who provided sera before or within 14 d of starting antituberculous treatment..	[[101, 103], [134, 136]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10096	The participants constituted adults and children, with and without HIV infection, with suspected or confirmed active TB, from all clinical settings (clinic or hospital).	[[117, 119]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml

10100	The target conditions were pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB..	[[56, 58]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10101	Pulmonary TB required positivity on mycobacterial culture.	[[10, 12]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10102	(The previous review accepted positivity on either culture or smear microscopy as the reference standard [12].) Extrapulmonary TB required positivity on at least one of the following tests: culture, smear, or histopathological examination..	[[127, 129]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10103	Sensitivity refers to the proportion of patients with a positive serological test result among patients with TB confirmed by the reference standard.	[[109, 111]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10104	Specificity refers to the proportion of participants with a negative serological test result among participants without TB according to the reference standard.	[[120, 122]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10105	To estimate specificity, we selected only one non-TB group if a study had more than one such group.	[[50, 52]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10106	The preferred non-TB participants were those in whom active TB was initially suspected but later ruled out (“other respiratory disease” or “mixed disease” groups), and who were from the same population as TB patients..	[[18, 20], [60, 62], [205, 207]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10107	Extrapulmonary TB was classified as lymph node, pleural, meningeal and/or central nervous system, bone and/or joint, genitourinary, abdominal, skin, other sites, disseminated, and multiple sites (extrapulmonary TB cases from different sites are combined to obtain at least ten extrapulmonary TB cases)..

10108	The following studies were excluded: (1) studies published before 1990; (2) animal studies; (3) conference abstracts and proceedings; (4) studies on the detection of latent TB infection; (5) studies on nontuberculous mycobacterial infection; (6) studies that used non-immunological methods for detection of antibodies; and (7) basic science literature that focused on detection/cloning of new antigens or their immunological properties (i.e., early pre-clinical studies)..	[[173, 175]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10109	Two reviewers independently extracted data from included studies with the standardized form on the following characteristics: study design; age group (children <15 y of age); HIV status; case country of residence; sputum smear status (pulmonary TB); site of TB (extrapulmonary TB); assay type (e.g., ELISA, immunochromatographic test); antibody class detected (IgG, IgM, and IgA); serological test name; antigen composition; condition of the specimen (fresh or frozen); and sensitivity and specificity (data were extracted as true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives).

10112	While extracting data, we looked for studies that considered the added value of serological tests to determine if they contributed to active TB diagnosis beyond that ascertained by conventional tests such as symptoms, sputum smears, and chest radiographs.	[[141, 143]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10113	Patient-important outcomes for this review could include an increased number of TB patients detected, decreased time to starting treatment, increased number of patients starting TB treatment, decreased number of false-positive TB patients treated, and decreased number of patients lost because of a reduced number of visits.	[[80, 82], [178, 180], [227, 229]]	[]	['TB', 'TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10114	Two reviewers (KRS and LLF) independently assessed study quality using the core set of 11 items from Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS), a validated tool to evaluate the presence of bias and variation in diagnostic accuracy studies [21].	[[152, 158]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10115	As recommended, we scored each item as “yes,” “no,” or “unclear.” We considered representative patient spectrum (i.e., was the spectrum of patients representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice?) to be persons suspected of having active TB who were consecutively or randomly enrolled.	[[260, 262]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10116	For pulmonary TB, a score of “yes” for representative spectrum also required that patients were evaluated in an outpatient setting.	[[14, 16]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10117	“Differential verification avoided” was scored as “yes” if all participants suspected of having TB were evaluated with the same reference standard or if participants without TB were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy.	[[96, 98], [174, 176]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10118	Finally, we grouped studies according to the type of serological test or site of TB (in the case of extrapulmonary TB) and assessed study quality separately for each subgroup..	[[81, 83], [115, 117]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10119	Quality begins with a consideration of study design (e.g., randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies in patients with diagnostic uncertainty are considered high quality) and may be compromised by five factors: limitations (risk of bias assessed by QUADAS, such as absence of consecutive or random selection of participants and lack of blinding of test results), indirectness (lack of generalizability and use of test results as surrogates for patient-important outcomes), inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), imprecision (wide confidence intervals for estimates of test accuracy), and risk of publication bias [23]..	[[263, 269]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10120	We recognized that studies were heterogeneous in many respects, particularly concerning the serological test used, antibody class detected, sputum smear status (pulmonary TB), and site of extrapulmonary TB.	[[171, 173]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10121	This classification resulted in seven subgroups for meta-analysis (four pulmonary and three extrapulmonary TB subgroups).	[[107, 109]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10122	Finally, a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve was plotted for selected meta-analyses.	[[67, 72]]	[[11, 65]]	['HSROC']	['hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic']	PMC3153457.nxml
10123	The HSROC curve plots sensitivity versus specificity and provides information on the overall performance of a test across different thresholds.	[[4, 9]]	[]	['HSROC']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10124	All but one study reported recruiting TB and non-TB patients from the same underlying population [56].	[[38, 40], [49, 51]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10125	Fifty-four (81%) studies used ELISA, 12 (18%) studies used an immunochromatographic assay, and one study used a kaolin precipitation test.	[[30, 35]]	[]	['ELISA']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10126	The median number of TB patients included in each study was 41 (interquartile range 33 to 54).	[[21, 23]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10127	Eighteen serological tests were included; anda-TB (IgG, IgA, and IgM) was the test most frequently evaluated (16/67 [24%]) (Table 1).	[[47, 49]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10128	Of the tests with known antigens, all had unique antigenic compositions except for anda-TB and Hexagon, which both contained antigen A60..	[[88, 90]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml

[[10, 12]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10131	As assessed with QUADAS, studies had very serious limitations.	[[17, 23]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10132	Of the total 67 studies only 19 (28%) were considered to include a representative patient population (we scored this item as “yes” when ambulatory patients suspected of having active TB were randomly or consecutively selected), and 34 (51%) studies reported blinding of the serological test result.	[[183, 185]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10133	As assessed with QUADAS, only 14 (50%) of the total 28 studies were considered to include a representative patient population.	[[17, 23]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10134	According to our prespecified analysis plan, there was a sufficient number of studies to perform a meta-analysis for only one serological test, anda-TB IgG, with results stratified by smear status (seven studies of smear-positive and four studies of smear-negative patients).	[[149, 151]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10135	In studies of smear-positive patients, no studies were considered to have a representative patient population (participants were known TB cases rather than suspected cases, were inpatients, and/or were enrolled by convenience), and only two studies reported blinding of the serological test result [43],[52] (Figure S1).	[[135, 137]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10136	In studies involving smear-positive patients, anda-TB IgG yielded a pooled sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 63–87) and a pooled specificity of 92% (95% CI 74–98).	[[51, 53]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10137	In studies involving smear-negative patients, the pooled sensitivity of anda-TB IgG decreased to 59% (95% CI 10–96); the 95% CI was very wide, reflecting the imprecision of the sensitivity estimate.	[[77, 79]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10138	The HSROC curves show the decreased performance of the test in smear-negative patients compared with smear-positive patients (Figure 6)..	[[4, 9]]	[]	['HSROC']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml

10141	Compared with ELISA (pooled sensitivity 60% [95% CI 6–65]; pooled specificity 98% [95% CI 96–99]), immunochromatographic assays yielded lower pooled sensitivity (53%, 95% CI 42–64) and comparable pooled specificity (98%, 95% CI 94–99) (Table 2; Figure 7).	[[14, 19]]	[]	['ELISA']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml

10144	In two studies (reported from one paper), 13 of 35 extrapulmonary TB cases occurred in children; however, data were not provided separately for the children [67].	[[66, 68]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10145	Of 25 total studies, serological tests were evaluated for diagnosis of the following forms of extrapulmonary TB: lymph node, six studies; pleural, five studies; multiple sites, five studies (see Table S3 for a list of sites involved); genitourinary, two studies; disseminated, four studies; and meningeal, one study.	[[109, 111]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10146	Six distinct serological tests were evaluated; 17 (68%) of the total 25 studies used anda-TB (IgG, ten studies; IgM, five studies; IgA, one study; IgM plus IgA, one study).	[[90, 92]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10147	The median number of TB patients included in each study was 35 (interquartile range 30 to 56).	[[21, 23]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10148	There was a sufficient number of studies to perform a meta-analysis for only one serological test, anda-TB IgG (ten studies).	[[104, 106]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10149	As assessed with QUADAS, studies had very serious limitations.	[[17, 23]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10150	We determined pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for studies evaluating any serological test for the diagnosis of lymph node or pleural TB and for studies using anda-TB IgG (all extrapulmonary sites).	[[146, 148], [176, 178]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10151	For lymph node TB, pooled sensitivity was 64% (95% CI 28–92) and pooled specificity was 90% (95% CI 76–97).	[[15, 17]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10152	For pleural TB, pooled sensitivity was 46% (95% CI 29–63) and pooled specificity was 87% (95% CI 51–99).	[[12, 14]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10153	For anda-TB IgG, pooled sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 49–97) and pooled specificity was 85% (95% CI 77–92) (Table 2).	[[9, 11]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10154	The only study identified involving HIV-infected patients evaluated the performance of the MycoDot test (Mossman Associates) in a cross-sectional study of patients suspected of having TB in Thailand [68].	[[184, 186]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10155	In all, 142 HIV-infected (mean CD4 cell count = 188 cells/mm3 [range 7 to 632]) and 144 HIV-uninfected patients with newly diagnosed TB participated in the study, of whom 50 patients (40 HIV-infected and ten HIV-uninfected patients) had a diagnosis of lymph node TB established by culture or histopathological examination.	[[133, 135], [263, 265]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10156	Compared with the sensitivity of MycoDot in HIV-uninfected TB patients (80%, 95% CI 44–98), the sensitivity of the test in HIV-infected TB patients was considerably lower (33%, 95% CI 19–39).	[[59, 61], [136, 138]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10157	For the pulmonary TB studies, the quality of the body of evidence supporting TB serology's estimates of sensitivity and specificity was graded as “very low” (Tables 3 and 4).	[[18, 20], [77, 79]]	[]	['TB', 'TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml

10161	This updated systematic review assessing the diagnostic accuracy of commercial serological tests for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB summarizes the current literature and includes 14 new papers (approximately 30% of the included papers) identified since our previous reviews [12],[13].	[[130, 132]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10162	In the earlier systematic reviews, we recommended the use of guidelines such as STARD (Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) [70] and QUADAS [21] to improve methodological study quality.	[[156, 162]]	[]	['QUADAS']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10163	For example, in the pulmonary TB group there were 16 new studies.	[[30, 32]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10164	The very low quality of evidence for the studies evaluating anda-TB IgG in smear-negative patients decreases our confidence in the pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates.	[[65, 67]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10165	If the pooled estimates of test accuracy had been derived from high-quality studies, then the serological test might have been shown to have some clinical utility for contributing to diagnostic algorithms for smear-negative TB, especially since the tests are relatively inexpensive, rapid, and easy to perform.	[[224, 226]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10166	Strengths of our review include the use of a standard protocol and comprehensive search strategy, two independent reviewers at all stages of the review process, the assessment of methodological quality of individual studies with the QUADAS tool, and the use of the GRADE approach.

10168	However, the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases report on rapid serological tests for TB mentioned above did evaluate the added value of smear plus serology and reported a gain equivalent to the detection of 57% of the smear-negative, culture-positive TB cases.

10169	Recent studies from a number of laboratories have reported several new potential candidate antigens that may be expected to lead to improved antibody detection tests for TB in the future.	[[170, 172]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10170	The findings from this systematic review were used as the input for a cost-effectiveness study of serological testing for active TB in India [76].	[[129, 131]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10171	In comparison with sputum microscopy, serological testing resulted in fewer disability-adjusted life years averted and more false-positive diagnoses and secondary infections, while increasing costs to the Indian TB control sector approximately 4-fold.	[[212, 214]]	[]	['TB']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10172	This cost-effectiveness study and the findings from our updated systematic review were considered by a WHO Expert Group on Serodiagnostics, and in July 2011, the WHO published a policy statement on commercial serodiagnostic tests for diagnosis of TB.	[[103, 106], [162, 165]]	[]	['WHO', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10173	It is therefore recommended that these tests should not be used in individuals suspected of active pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB, irrespective of their HIV status.” The WHO policy strongly encourages targeted further research to identify new/alternative point-of-care tests for TB diagnosis and/or serological tests with improved accuracy [77]..

10182	This systematic review was commissioned by the WHO with funding provided by USAID through a grant administered by the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR).	[[47, 50], [141, 144]]	[]	['WHO', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3153457.nxml
10183	To better assess progress, we developed annual estimates for neonatal mortality rates (NMRs) and neonatal deaths for 193 countries for the period 1990–2009 with forecasts into the future..	[[87, 90]]	[[61, 84]]	['NMR']	['neonatal mortality rate']	PMC3168874.nxml
10184	A statistical model was developed to estimate NMRs for the remaining 155 countries, 17 of which had no national data.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10185	Between 1990 and 2009, the global NMR declined by 28% from 33.2 deaths per 1,000 livebirths to 23.9.	[[34, 37]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10186	While NMRs were halved in some regions of the world, Africa's NMR only dropped 17.6% (43.6 to 35.9)..	[[6, 9], [62, 65]]	[]	['NMR', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10187	Progress has been slowest in the regions with high NMRs.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10188	To improve survival rates and to monitor the effects of public-health interventions in this vulnerable group, accurate, up-to-date estimates of national neonatal mortality rates (NMRs, the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births) are essential.	[[179, 182]]	[[153, 176]]	['NMR']	['neonatal mortality rate']	PMC3168874.nxml
10189	Although infant (under-one) and under-five mortality rates are estimated annually for individual countries by the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, annual NMR trend estimates have not been produced before.	[[186, 189]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10190	In this study, the researchers estimate annual national NMRs and numbers of neonatal deaths for the past 20 years using the available data..	[[56, 59]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10191	They estimated NMRs for 38 countries from reliable vital registration data and developed a statistical model to estimate NMRs for the remaining 155 countries (in which 92% of global live births occurred).	[[15, 18], [121, 124]]	[]	['NMR', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10192	Between 1990 and 2009, although the global NMR decreased from 33.2 to 23.9 deaths per 1,000 live births (a decrease of 28%), NMRs increased in eight countries, five of which were in Africa.	[[43, 46], [125, 128]]	[]	['NMR', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10193	Moreover, in Africa as a whole, the NMR only decreased by 17.6%, from 43.6 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 35.9 per 1,000 live births in 2009..	[[36, 39]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10194	These and other findings suggest that neonatal mortality has declined in all world regions since 1990 but that progress has been slowest in the regions with high NMRs such as Africa.	[[162, 165]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10195	In high-income countries (HIC), neonates are now a major focus of child health both for mortality and morbidity reduction.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['HIC']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10196	However, in lower-income countries neonatal mortality rates (NMRs), trends, and causes have attracted relatively little attention compared to maternal deaths or deaths among older children under 5 and in international public health policy and programmes, neonatal deaths still do not receive attention commensurate with their burden [2].	[[61, 64]]	[[35, 58]]	['NMR']	['neonatal mortality rate']	PMC3168874.nxml
10197	The single most important factor behind increased attention for neonatal deaths is Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4, which calls for a two-thirds reduction in mortality risks of children under 5 y of age between 1990 and 2015, equivalent to an average annual reduction of 4.4% [2].	[[112, 115]]	[]	['MDG']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10198	One key action to increase attention and guide action is the availability of annual estimates by country of the NMR (the probability of dying in the first 28 d of life) [8],[9]; this remains a gap.	[[112, 115]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10199	United Nations (UN) partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), have produced maternal mortality ratio (MMR) estimates every 5 y [10].	[[16, 18], [68, 71]]	[]	['UN', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10200	Each year the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME) produces national estimates of infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-five mortality rate (U5MR).	[[68, 72], [164, 168], [14, 16]]	[[137, 162]]	['IGME', 'U5MR', 'UN']	['under-five mortality rate']	PMC3168874.nxml
10201	The sources of NMR data are very similar to those for under-five mortality and available in the same countries and with the same frequency, yet so far NMR estimates have not been part of this annual process, and publication of neonatal mortality estimates has been unpredictable in timing and used changing methods, which has limited trend analysis and reduced policy attention.	[[15, 18], [151, 154]]	[]	['NMR', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10202	During 2010, national and global estimates for both maternal [12],[13] and child mortality [14],[15] were published by both the UN and by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).	[[186, 190], [128, 130]]	[]	['IHME', 'UN']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10203	IHME's child mortality publication and the associated media interest were primarily focused on under-five mortality, and national and regional estimates of NMR and neonatal deaths were provided for only 2 y, 1990 and 2010..	[[156, 159]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10204	Given defects or deficiencies in existing empirical NMR data, statistical estimation will be necessary for most countries for the foreseeable future [18], and a key message is that countries, academics, and UN agencies have a role to play in improving the data and methods and in ensuring transparency..	[[52, 55], [207, 209]]	[]	['NMR', 'UN']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10205	In this article we build on these lessons to develop an improved modeling approach for national estimates of NMRs for the years 1990 to 2009 and for forecasts of future trends.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10206	Our work is linked to a wider collaboration between UN agencies and academic research groups to understand and estimate rates (www.childinfo.org/mortality_igme.html) and causes of deaths in neonates and children (Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group, www.cherg.org) in order to inform public health policy.	[[52, 54]]	[]	['UN']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10207	In addition, a country consultation process was undertaken by WHO to maximize identification of all input data and to allow countries to review and provide feedback to estimates..	[[62, 65]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10208	Data on neonatal mortality come from a variety of sources, including civil registration systems and household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS; www.measuredhs.com), as well as special studies.	[[158, 161]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10209	This inverse relationship naturally leads to uncertainties in global, regional, and country estimates of NMRs..	[[105, 108]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10210	The most common data source globally for child and neonatal mortality is retrospective household surveys such as the DHS, which rely on birth histories and do report neonatal outcomes.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10211	UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) are an increasing source of national estimates for under-five mortality but usually rely on demographic indirect estimation techniques that have been developed to estimate mortality rates when exact information on times of births and deaths of children is missing, and usually do not provide estimates of NMRs.	[[356, 359]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10212	Some MICS have used birth histories and have reported NMR (Malawi and several of the central Asian Republics).	[[54, 57]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10213	To ensure consistency with U5MR estimates produced for the UN by IGME and to account for variation in survey-to-survey measurement errors, we rescaled U5MR and NMR data points for all years to match the latest time series estimates of U5MR produced by IGME [14].	[[65, 69], [252, 256], [160, 163], [27, 31], [151, 155], [235, 239], [59, 61]]	[]	['IGME', 'IGME', 'NMR', 'U5MR', 'U5MR', 'U5MR', 'UN']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml

10215	A country consultation was undertaken by WHO between December 2010 and January 2011 to give the Ministry of Health in each of the 193 countries the opportunity to review all data inputs and NMR draft estimates for the years 1990, 2000, and 2009 for their country.	[[190, 193], [41, 44]]	[]	['NMR', 'WHO']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10216	No countries had comments on the NMR estimates themselves, but 18 countries provided a total of 19 additional data points—all civil registration data points for the years 2008 and 2009.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10217	The final input database included 3,551 country-years with data from 176 countries representing all WHO regions.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['WHO']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10218	Civil registration and surveillance system data provided 2,378 data points, and household survey data 1,173 data points (of which 976 were from DHS) (Figure 1).	[[144, 147]]	[]	['DHS']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml

10227	For countries with high-quality civil registration data covering at least 17 of the 20 y in the period 1990–2009, and with no more than two consecutive years without data, NMR estimates were taken directly from civil registration systems and rescaled by the same proportion as the IGME adjustment to U5MR as outlined above.

10235	The curve was drawn with country and regional random effects assumed zero to show the assumed functional relationship between U5MR and NMR—in practice, within our multilevel statistical model, these random effects vary by country and region, respectively, such that the precise functional relationship between NMR and U5MR differs between countries.

10236	Compared to the green curve, the blue curve allows for more plausible changes in NMR at lower levels of U5MR; particularly, the green curve implies impossible NMRs at small U5MRs for countries and regions with positive random effects, as NMR would exceed U5MR.

10257	Over the period 1990–2009, regions fall into three broad categories in terms of NMR level (Figure 5): HICs have much lower NMR and fewer neonatal deaths compared to the rest of the world, currently accounting for 1.4% of annual global neonatal deaths.	[[102, 105], [80, 83], [123, 126]]	[]	['HIC', 'NMR', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10258	Yet these countries continue to see major relative reductions in NMR, from 6.0 to 3.6 per 1,000 livebirths between 1990 and 2009—a 40% reduction, and greater than the global average reduction.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml

10263	This reflects the slower annual reduction in NMR in Africa LMIC compared to other regions of the world (Table 1), and that Africa LMIC has seen a 39.2% increase in annual births between 1990 and 2009, whereas annual births have decreased for most other regions of the world (Table S4)..

10269	These trends in NMRs between 1990 and 2009 are a result of U5MR being estimated by IGME to have been increasing or been constant over the period, respectively (Figure 7).	[[83, 87], [16, 19], [59, 63]]	[]	['IGME', 'NMR', 'U5MR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml

10273	The input database is extensive and the modeling methods have been improved over previous exercises by UN agencies [5], yet uncertainty remains wide and may not fully capture remaining issues around underestimation and misclassification of neonatal deaths and stillbirths.

10274	Instead, we rescaled NMR and U5MR input data to match U5MR estimates produced by IGME.	[[21, 24], [29, 33], [54, 58]]	[]	['NMR', 'U5MR', 'U5MR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml

10276	Although Africa is now the region with the highest NMR, the proportion of under-five child deaths that are neonatal remains relatively low in Africa—the fraction increased from 26% to 29% between 1990 and 2009.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10277	Globally, the average annual reduction in NMR appears to be accelerating and was twice as high for the period 1999–2009 (2.3%) compared to that experienced in the period 1990–1999 (1.1%).	[[42, 45]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10278	Only HIC experienced lower average reduction in NMR in the period 1999–2009 (1.7%) compared to that experienced in the period 1990–1999 (3.7%), which may reflect the challenge of reducing mortality in very preterm babies.	[[5, 8], [48, 51]]	[]	['HIC', 'NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10279	However, while progress appears to be increasing, the average annual rate of NMR reduction is well below the MDG-4 goal (of 4.4%) at 1.7% per year globally in the period 1990–2009, and less than for under-five mortality at 2.1% per year in the same period [14] and maternal mortality over the period 1990–2008 at 2.3% per year [12]..

10281	Although this forecast is simplistic as it assumes that the average annual rate of reduction in Africa experienced between 1999 and 2009 will remain constant over the next 160 y in Africa (see Figure 8), it highlights the very high current NMR levels in Africa and the very slow progress in NMR reduction compared to other regions of the world, particularly to HIC..

10286	However, we excluded data from MCHSS prior to 1999 because of uncertainty about the quality of data [29], and used the statistical model to predict NMRs for China for the whole time period, 1990–2009.	[[148, 151]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10287	In our statistical model, the only predictor of NMR that can change over time is U5MR.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['NMR']	[]	PMC3168874.nxml
10288	Our model allows for a nonlinear association between NMR and U5MR on a logarithmic scale, and for the ratio of NMR to U5MR to vary depending on U5MR, country, and region (see Methods, Figure 4 in particular).

10323	These findings indicate that access to psychotropic medicines in LAMICs is related to key components within the mental health systems of these countries but that availability and affordability are affected to different extents by these components.	[[65, 70]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10324	They are also limited by the relatively small number of observations included in this study, by the methods used to collect mental health systems data in many LAMICs, and by the possibility that some countries may have reported biased results.	[[159, 164]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10325	Information on WHO-AIMS, including versions of the instrument in several languages, and WHO-AIMS country reports are available.	[[15, 23], [88, 96]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS', 'WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10326	Access to treatments for mental disorders is inadequate in a large majority of low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs).	[[113, 118]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10327	Roughly 80% of persons with mental illnesses live in LAMICs [4].	[[53, 58]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10328	In terms of the cost-effectiveness of interventions in LAMIC settings, one recent systematic review found over 450 trials on the utility of first generation antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia, in addition to more than 200 trials on tricyclic antidepressants for major depressive disorder, both of which are stated as cost-effective by the Disease Control Priorities Project [36].	[[55, 60]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10329	Nevertheless, access to medicines—both in terms of availability and affordability—is exceedingly limited in LAMIC settings, and only a small number of studies have critically analyzed access to psychotropic medicines in LAMICs.	[[108, 113], [220, 225]]	[]	['LAMIC', 'LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10330	According to the World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS), these building blocks include leadership and governance, the distribution of human resources for mental health, a system of health services delivery, a scheme for financing and appropriating resources, access to treatments including a human rights framework to protect patients, and an information systems to collect data and monitor performance over time [48].	[[92, 100]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10331	Sixty-three countries or country regions that completed the WHO-AIMS before June 2010 were included in the study.	[[60, 68]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10332	Of the 63 LAMICs, 58 provided sufficient information on availability of psychotropic medicines and 54 on affordability.	[[10, 15]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10333	WHO-AIMS was created in 2004 as a tool for enabling LAMICs to evaluate core components of their mental health systems, with the ultimate goal of providing critical information for the strengthening of mental health policies and service delivery [48].	[[52, 57]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10334	A full overview of the data collection process and instrument content is available at the WHO's WHO-AIMS web page [52]..	[[96, 104]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10335	The five health system domains assessed in this study map closely to the conceptual framework outlined in WHO-AIMS and WHO Mental Health Atlas instruments and represent core content areas of most well-functioning systems.	[[106, 114]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10336	The WHO-AIMS instrument contains information on both the existence and contents of national mental health policies, plans, and laws.	[[4, 12]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10337	Respondents to the WHO-AIMS are asked to identify whether the country inspects human rights violations at mental hospitals and at community-based inpatient psychiatric units, as well as whether staff at both types of facilities are trained on the human rights protections of patients.	[[19, 27]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10338	This figure pertains to expenditures allocated by governments' health departments and therefore does not include the private sector; however, in most LAMICs, public provisions are the primary source of mental health care..	[[150, 155]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10339	Separate measurements were created for the three most prominent of these groups: user associations, associations comprised of those affected by mental illness; family member associations, associations formed by family members of those affected by mental illness; and additional nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).	[[309, 312]]	[[278, 306]]	['NGO']	['nongovernmental organization']	PMC3269418.nxml
10340	For NGOs, the overall rate of membership per 100,000 population was used..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['NGO']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10341	Separate scales, based on WHO-AIMS responses, were created for each of these constructs..	[[26, 34]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10342	Availability of psychotropic medicines is operationally defined within the WHO-AIMS instrument as “the percentage of mental health facilities in which there is at least one psychotropic medication of each therapeutic category (antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizer, anxiolytic medicines, and antiepileptic medicines) available all year long.” These percentages were averaged across the four types of mental health facilities within countries—mental hospitals, outpatient facilities, community-based inpatient facilities, and primary care facilities—in order that the final measure of availability reflect all potential points of patient access [5]..	[[75, 83]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10343	Regarding the former, WHO-AIMS provides a figure for the price of the lowest-cost generic antidepressant available within the country relative to minimum wage.	[[22, 30]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10344	On the one hand, including a composite measure of these, best embodied by the Human Development Index (HDI) [58], allows for inspection of the role of different mental health system domains while controlling for the effects of these more general factors.	[[103, 106]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10345	This would, in turn, benefit external validity and permit greater generalizability of results across LAMICs.	[[101, 106]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10346	On the other hand, given that the functional integrity of health systems is itself intrinsically related to measures like income per capita and life expectancy, controlling for HDI may risk diminishing ecological validity insofar as doing so creates an artificial scenario in which HDI is exogenous to health systems measurements.	[[177, 180], [282, 285]]	[]	['HDI', 'HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10347	To accommodate both perspectives, regression analyses were performed first without and then with HDI as a covariate..	[[97, 100]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10348	Regressions were first run without the HDI measurement as a covariate and then with this measurement included.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10349	On this measure, there was only one instance in which this test was marginally significant (p = 0.05): namely, when availability was regressed on measures of governance (i.e., specificity of national mental health plans and legislation), without the inclusion of HDI as a covariate.	[[263, 266]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10350	In contrast, participation of user associations (β = 5.55, p>0.05) and other NGOs (β = −1.09, p>0.05) was not significantly related with availability.	[[77, 80]]	[]	['NGO']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10351	When the HDI was taken into account as a covariate, the percent of health expenditures on mental health (β = 1.99, p>0.05) became nonsignificant as an independent variable, a finding to be expected given that income per capita, one aspect of HDI, is strongly associated with allocation of financing and medicine availability.	[[9, 12], [242, 245]]	[]	['HDI', 'HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10352	Additionally, the effect of mental health laws (β = 1.00, p>0.05) and treatment protocols (β = 3.64, p>0.05) became nonsignificant with the inclusion of HDI, although there was a trend towards significance (p<0.10) in the latter..	[[153, 156]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10353	Across health systems domains, no indicator variable remained significant when HDI was included as a covariate.	[[79, 82]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10354	However, HDI itself was strongly associated with medicine costs to consumers (r = −0.38, p<0.01) and played a significant role in regression analyses, as such indicating the centrality of overall country development in relation to affordability of medicines to consumers.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10355	To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between health systems measures and access to psychotropic medicines across a diverse group of LAMICs.	[[164, 169]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10356	Additionally, there is an underestimation of the magnitude of mental health problems in LAMICs, which is compounded by stigma and negative cultural perceptions towards these problems [64]..	[[88, 93]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10357	In contrast, user association involvement and the presence of NGOs were not significant.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['NGO']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10358	This latter view is supported by the finding that the association between protocols and availability is weakened by the inclusion of HDI..	[[133, 136]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10359	Without taking HDI into account, only three independent variables were significantly associated with affordability: the percentage of health expenditures directed towards mental health, the number of human resources working in the field of mental health (per 100,000 population), and availability of mental health care to prisoners..	[[15, 18]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10360	On the other hand, overall country development, as reflected by HDI, might have a role in determining whether the country has resources available.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10361	This finding is supported by the role of HDI, which, when included as a covariate, contributes to the nonsignificance of both variables (i.e., the effects of financial and human resources) at the 0.05 alpha level..	[[41, 44]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10362	Irrespective of a country's development status as measured by HDI, the integrity of mental health systems remains associated with availability of medicines, but not to affordability of medicines to consumers.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10363	For example, Large and colleagues found a significant association between country GDP and duration of untreated psychosis in LAMICs, whereby mean duration of untreated psychosis fell by 6 wk for every US$1,000 of GDP (purchasing power parity) [70].	[[125, 130]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10364	In a similar vein, wealthier LAMICs are more likely to publish research on mental disorders [71].	[[29, 34]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10365	These findings, as well as those concluded upon from this study, underscore a common narrative: country wealth and development appear to play central roles in promoting the mental health research and treatment agenda of LAMICs..	[[220, 225]]	[]	['LAMIC']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10366	In addition to the meta-level impact of HDI on affordability, it is also important to note the wide variation in affordability scores across countries at similar levels of HDI, as indicated by the dispersion of data points in Figure 2.	[[40, 43], [172, 175]]	[]	['HDI', 'HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10367	As more countries participate in the WHO-AIMS project, such analyses will become increasingly feasible..	[[37, 45]]	[]	['WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10368	Moreover, while the inclusion of HDI as a covariate has the effect of making independent measures more comparable across countries, it also risks overcontrolling for social processes, as it is not a strictly economic measure..	[[33, 36]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10369	Lastly, while WHO-AIMS data are collected by country focal points using a specific set of instructions and are reviewed by WHO headquarters, the data are still imprecise insofar as most LAMICs do not have advanced technologies for gathering mental health systems data.	[[186, 191], [14, 22]]	[]	['LAMIC', 'WHO-AIMS']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10370	While correlates of availability remained significant when controlling for HDI, none remained significant in relation to affordability.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10371	Furthermore, in light of the heterogeneity of findings across countries at similar levels of HDI, research should continue to identify what kinds of interventions can positively influence affordability, including within the health sector..	[[93, 96]]	[]	['HDI']	[]	PMC3269418.nxml
10372	They would also like to thank focal points and associated Ministries of Health who/that participated in the WHO-AIMS data collection process: Sayed Azimi (Afghanistan); Neli Demi (Albania); Margaret Hazlewood (Anguilla); Armen Soghoyan, Suren Krmoyan, Harutyun Davtyan, and Marietta Khurshudyan (Armenia); Shirin Kazimov, Fuad Ismayilov, Murad Sultanov, and Sabuhi Abdullayev (Azerbaijan); A.H.

10374	Published 2015 ex-factory prices for a 12-wk course of treatment were provided by the Pharma Price Information (PPI) service of the Austrian public health institute Gesundheit Österreich GmbH or were obtained from national government or drug reimbursement authorities and recent press releases, where necessary.

10376	We analysed prices compared to national economic performance and estimated market size and the cost of these drugs in terms of countries’ annual total pharmaceutical expenditure (TPE) and in terms of the duration of time an individual would need to work to pay for treatment out of pocket.	[[179, 182]]	[[145, 177]]	['TPE']	['total pharmaceutical expenditure']	PMC4886962.nxml

10378	The median nominal ex-factory price of a 12-wk course of sofosbuvir across 26 OECD countries was US$42,017, ranging from US$37,729 in Japan to US$64,680 in the US.	[[78, 82]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10379	Central and Eastern European countries had higher PPP-adjusted prices than other countries: prices of sofosbuvir in Poland and Turkey (PPP$101,063 and PPP$70,331) and of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Poland (PPP$118,754) were at least 1.09 and 1.63 times higher, respectively than in the US (PPP$64,680 and PPP$72,765).	[[50, 53]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10380	Based on PPP-adjusted TPE and without the cost of ribavirin and other treatment costs, treating the entire HCV viraemic population with these regimens at the PPP-adjusted prices with a 23% price reduction would amount to at least one-tenth of current TPE across the countries included in this study, ranging from 10.5% of TPE in the Netherlands to 190.5% of TPE in Poland.

10382	Although the precise prevalence is uncertain, a recent analysis estimated that 80 million people globally were living with HCV viraemia (also known as chronic HCV infection), with a range of 64–103 million people [1].	[[123, 126], [159, 162]]	[]	['HCV', 'HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10383	If left untreated, chronic HCV infection can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, leading to an estimated 700,000 deaths per year worldwide [2]..	[[27, 30]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10384	Until recently, standard guidelines for treating HCV infection recommended combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10385	While resulting in sustained virological response (SVR) in 54% to 63% of clinical trial participants [3], this combination requires 24 to 48 wk of therapy and has severe side effects such as haemolytic anaemia and flu-like symptoms [4].

10390	Since then, other DAA regimens have gained regulatory approval, but sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir dominate the market [7]..	[[18, 21]]	[]	['DAA']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10391	The manufacturer claimed the new regimen was equal to or less expensive than prior standard of care regimens because the new regimen had much higher cure rates and would reduce the total treatment costs of HCV, including the costs of medications, side effects, complications, and additional health services required [8,9].	[[206, 209]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10392	As a consequence of the high prices of the new HCV medicines, payers in high-income countries have been restricting coverage (e.g., United States) [17], negotiating public deals and private discounts and rebates with the manufacturer (e.g., France and Germany [18]), or delaying reimbursement until a reasonable price has been negotiated (e.g., Australia [19])..

10404	To estimate the population requiring HCV treatment, we used the prevalence estimates of viraemic HCV infection by Gower and colleagues [1] rather than the number of persons with anti-HCV antibodies [31] because approximately 25% of persons who acquire HCV clear the infection spontaneously [32].

10405	Based on the WHO treatment guidelines [33], we assumed in our base case analysis that all adults with viraemic HCV infection were eligible for treatment, and patients would receive a 12-wk treatment regimen of sofosbuvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir because a majority of patients have non–genotype 3 HCV.	[[111, 114]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10406	We compared the total estimated budget impact of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment with the country’s total expenditure on pharmaceuticals, based on the reported PPP-adjusted total pharmaceutical expenditure (TPE) per capita [34] multiplied by the population size [35].

10413	The OECD dataset contained wage information for all countries of interest except for Brazil, Egypt, Iceland, and Turkey.	[[4, 8]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10414	For these countries, we used the median nominal monthly earnings (converted to annual earnings) of employees reported in the United Nations International Labour Organization Global Wage Database [44], with linear extrapolation of historical data to 2014 values and with PPP adjustments..	[[270, 273]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10415	We estimated TPE based on the mean and range of values of prevalence of hepatitis C viraemia presented in Gower et al.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10416	We also carried out an analysis to adjust the total expenditure on sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the proportion of patients in each country infected with genotype 3 HCV, based on the genotype distribution estimated by Gower et al.	[[176, 179]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10417	There are two sources of uncertainty when estimating the duration of full-time paid employment required for a patient to pay for a full course of treatment: the income level of HCV patients and the level of out-of-pocket payment.	[[177, 180]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10418	We used the published average or median wage in different countries as the indicator of patient income, assuming that people with HCV infection have the same income as the general population.	[[130, 133]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10419	This is a conservative assumption because some HCV patients are intravenous drug users who typically have low incomes, low employment, and low levels of education [36,37].	[[47, 50]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10420	For this analysis of the patient affordability sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, we assumed that patients would pay for the treatment fully out of pocket because the level of coverage and co-payments varies considerably across health systems, types of insurance and benefits packages, and characteristics of HCV patients.	[[312, 315]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10421	It could be expected that in high-income countries with universal health coverage, such as European OECD countries, prices of HCV medicines would be fully covered by public payers if the eligibility criteria for reimbursement were met.

10430	In countries with stronger purchasing power, PPP adjustment resulted in lower prices.	[[45, 48]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10431	For example, as illustrated in Fig 1A, the PPP-adjusted price in Norway was 0.67 times less than its nominal price (US$42,148, PPP$28,092).	[[43, 46]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10432	In contrast, countries with weaker purchasing power had a significant increase in price with PPP adjustment.	[[93, 96]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10433	For example, the PPP-adjusted price of sofosbuvir in India (PPP$1,861) was 3.45 times more than the nominal price (US$539).	[[17, 20]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10434	In the OECD, the PPP-adjusted prices were higher in Poland (PPP$101,063), Turkey (PPP$70,331), Slovakia (PPP$63,815), Portugal (PPP$57,384) than in higher-income European economies, particularly the Nordic countries (i.e., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland).

10436	The nominal price of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was the highest in the US (US$72,765 with 23% price reduction) and lowest in the UK (US$43,215) among the OECD countries.	[[149, 153]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10437	The price in Norway was the lowest after adjustment for PPP (PPP$31,255), reflecting the stronger purchasing power of its currency.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10438	The PPP-adjusted price of a 12-wk course of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was again higher in Poland (PPP$118,754) than in other countries, with the price being 3.8 times higher than the price in Norway (PPP$31,255)..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml

10442	There was no observable relationship between the PPP-adjusted price and potential market size (Fig 2).	[[49, 52]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10443	For example, Nordic countries had fewer people requiring HCV treatment (based on point estimates reported by Gower et al.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10444	[1]) and had higher GDP per capita than countries such as Japan, Italy, and Spain, but the PPP-adjusted prices of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were much lower.	[[20, 23], [91, 94]]	[]	['GDP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10445	Although the GDP per capita in Turkey was only about $3,000 higher than in Brazil, the PPP-adjusted price of sofosbuvir in Turkey (PPP$70,331) was 7.2-fold higher than in Brazil (PPP$9,708).	[[13, 16], [87, 90]]	[]	['GDP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10446	Luxembourg had the smallest estimated HCV population and the highest GDP per capita, but its price for sofosbuvir was less than the price in half of the other OECD countries..	[[69, 72], [38, 41], [159, 163]]	[]	['GDP', 'HCV', 'OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml

10449	For Japan, the point estimate of the total budget impact of providing treatment for 1.25 million people with HCV viraemia is close to PPP$50 billion.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10450	The PPP-adjusted expenditure for treating 2.58 million people with HCV viraemia (point estimate) in the US would be PPP$166.6 billion.	[[67, 70], [4, 7]]	[]	['HCV', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml

10452	Financial impact on national budgets is measured by multiplying the PPP-adjusted cost of the medicines (USD PPP) and the point estimates of adult population with HCV viraemia, as reported by Gower et al.	[[162, 165], [68, 71], [108, 111]]	[]	['HCV', 'PPP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml

10454	Compared to the PPP-adjusted TPE in each country, treating the entire HCV viraemic population (based on point estimates reported by Gower et al.	[[70, 73], [16, 19], [29, 32]]	[]	['HCV', 'PPP', 'TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10455	[1]) with sofosbuvir at the PPP-adjusted price with a 23% price reduction would amount to at least one-tenth of the current TPE in all countries (Table 3).	[[28, 31], [124, 127]]	[]	['PPP', 'TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10456	In Poland, treating the whole HCV viraemic population would amount to as much as 1.6 times the current TPE.	[[30, 33]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10457	If only 10% of the HCV viraemic population were treated, the expenditure on sofosbuvir would still be high in proportion to the TPE in Poland (16.2%; UI: 11.1%, 40.6%), New Zealand (15.5%; UI: 8.9%, 26.8%), Portugal (13.3%; UI: 8.7%, 23.0%), Italy (11.1%; UI: 7.5%, 21.4%), and Spain (10.0%; UI: 5.4%, 16.7%) because these countries have relatively high sofosbuvir prices and HCV prevalence.	[[19, 22], [376, 379], [128, 131], [150, 152], [189, 191], [224, 226], [256, 258], [292, 294]]	[]	['HCV', 'HCV', 'TPE', 'UI', 'UI', 'UI', 'UI', 'UI']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10458	In contrast, in the Netherlands, it would cost an amount equal to 1% (UI: 0.4%, 1.8%) of its current TPE to provide sofosbuvir to 10% of its infected population—even though the price of sofosbuvir is similar to in other OECD countries—because the estimated number of people with hepatitis C is relatively low.	[[220, 224], [101, 104], [70, 72]]	[]	['OECD', 'TPE', 'UI']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10459	The analyses of prices of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir produced similar results, where the expenditure on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir would cost an amount equal to a considerable proportion of the country’s current TPE, particularly in Poland (19.1%; UI: 13.0%, 45.1%), Portugal (16.5%; UI: 9.9%, 28.5%), New Zealand (15.1%; UI: 9.3%, 26.1%), Italy (12.3%; UI: 8.5%, 25.2%), and Spain (11.2%; UI: 5.4%, 17.0%) (Table 3)..

10460	The PPP-adjusted price of a full course of sofosbuvir alone would be equivalent to at least 1 y (365 d) of the PPP-adjusted average earnings for individuals in 12 of the 30 countries analysed (Fig 4A).	[[4, 7], [111, 114]]	[]	['PPP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10461	Assuming no price reduction, a HCV patient in Poland would have to spend 5.55 y and 6.52 y of earnings on a 12-wk course of treatment with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, respectively.	[[31, 34]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10462	Average annual wage—from OECD average annual wage or, in the case of Brazil, Egypt, Iceland, and Turkey, International Labour Organization Global Wage Database median nominal monthly earnings—is adjusted for PPP (USD PPP).	[[25, 29], [208, 211], [217, 220]]	[]	['OECD', 'PPP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10463	The duration of working time, expressed in years, required by patients to pay for a 12-wk course of treatment for each country is calculated from the PPP dollar price of the treatment and the average wage.	[[150, 153]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10464	Based on these assumptions, the estimated percentages of current TPE that would be required for countries to provide treatment for different percentages of the HCV-infected population were within the corresponding range of the values presented in Table 3.	[[160, 163], [65, 68]]	[]	['HCV', 'TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10465	S3 Text shows the findings assuming that patients with genotype 3 HCV would receive the recommended 24 wk of treatment with sofosbuvir.	[[66, 69]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10466	Under this scenario, the estimated percentages of current TPE at different levels of treatment coverage and the number of equivalent income years required to pay for full treatment increased by an average of 1.26-fold (SA range: 1.00; 1.54) compared to the base case estimates..	[[58, 61]]	[]	['TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10467	The lowest and highest nominal prices of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in OECD countries varied, respectively, by 1.71 times between Japan and the US and 1.68 times between the United Kingdom and the US.	[[81, 85]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10468	If the prices in LMICs under tiered pricing arrangements or licensing agreements are included, the prices vary by more than 100-fold.	[[17, 22]]	[]	['LMICs']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10469	Our analysis also shows that the PPP-adjusted prices of these medicines in Central and Eastern European countries are considerably and consistently higher than in other OECD countries, particularly compared to Nordic countries.	[[169, 173], [33, 36]]	[]	['OECD', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10470	We are aware of four recent publications that have also analysed the budget impact and price variation of new HCV medicines [22,46–48].	[[110, 113]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10471	Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) undertook a survey on the prices of six DAAs, including sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [22], although our study differs from the MSF study in a number of ways.	[[71, 74]]	[]	['DAA']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10472	The MSF study also found that the availability of most DAAs in low-income countries was low at the time of the survey, with the exception of sofosbuvir.	[[55, 58]]	[]	['DAA']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10473	The price disparities in OECD countries may be explained partly by the pharmaceutical price-setting policies used in different countries.	[[25, 29]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10474	For example, some countries set prices according to explicit cost-effectiveness thresholds based on GDP per capita [49], average monthly wage [50], or comparative assessment [51] against interferon-based therapy.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['GDP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10475	Another policy for price setting used by many OECD countries is external reference pricing.	[[46, 50]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10476	However, the PPP-adjusted price of sofosbuvir in Turkey (PPP$70,331) was 1.8 times higher than the price in France (PPP$38,077).	[[13, 16]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10477	Turkey’s GDP per capita (US$19,363) is more comparable to Brazil (US$16,320) than its current reference countries, but the nominal and PPP-adjusted prices of sofosbuvir in Turkey were 5.6 and 7.2 times higher, respectively, than the prices in Brazil.	[[9, 12], [135, 138]]	[]	['GDP', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10478	However, because Norway has greater purchasing power, PPP-adjusted prices indicate that the medicine may be more affordable for Norwegians in comparison to other countries in the OECD.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10479	Our analysis suggests that sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir are not “affordable” for most OECD countries at the nominal and PPP-adjusted prices, with Central and Eastern European countries being the most affected.	[[94, 98], [128, 131]]	[]	['OECD', 'PPP']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10480	While determining what is affordable or not is a value judgement, funding these treatments in these national health systems would consume large proportions of their TPE and increase pressure on existing budgets.	[[165, 168]]	[]	['TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10481	We calculated that even funding treatment for only 10% of the potential population requiring sofosbuvir treatment would amount to at least 1% (UI: 1%, 16.2%) of current TPE in all countries analysed.	[[169, 172], [143, 145]]	[]	['TPE', 'UI']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10482	The cost of treatment increases substantially if treatment uptake is higher than 10%: if half of the eligible patient population is treated, five countries would spend an amount equivalent to more than half of their current TPE on sofosbuvir.	[[224, 227]]	[]	['TPE']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10483	Thus, the potential total cost of treatment presents a dilemma for payers and physicians, with some systems currently restricting access to these medicines to small groups of patients, despite the fact that almost all patients with chronic HCV infection are likely to benefit [17]..	[[240, 243]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10484	It is not surprising that, given the price differences, HCV patients in high-income countries have been reported to import sofosbuvir at lower prices or even devise plans to receive treatment in India [54,55].	[[56, 59]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10485	However, neither this price reduction nor the sensitivity analysis using a 50% price reduction changes our overall conclusions about total expenditure on these HCV drugs in relation to TPE.	[[160, 163]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10486	Existing licensing agreements, similar to those that are in place for antiretrovirals, exclude the upper-middle income and OECD countries that are currently paying the highest prices.	[[123, 127]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10487	The World Health Organization currently recommends that all patients with chronic HCV should be assessed for treatment [33], but the challenge is clearly how to provide treatment at a total cost that health systems and patients can afford.	[[82, 85]]	[]	['HCV']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10488	Moreover, as illustrated in our analysis, affordable prices could not be achieved in many OECD countries, even if they have price control systems, which suggests a need for an updated pricing system.	[[90, 94]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10489	While generic competition is likely to reduce prices in countries that are included in voluntary licensing agreements or that will issue compulsory licences, the impact of these strategies is unlikely to impact prices in OECD countries.	[[221, 225]]	[]	['OECD']	[]	PMC4886962.nxml
10490	The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates.	[[47, 51]]	[]	['EBOV']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml

10501	Although the worst outbreaks have resulted in only several hundred deaths worldwide [3–6], the filoviruses are considered a significant global health threat, because as the reservoir remains unknown, the pathogen is extremely deadly and highly infectious by aerosol, and there is anecdotal evidence that the use of both MARV and EBOV were explored as potential biowarfare agents in the offensive program of the former Soviet Union [7–10].

10574	In contrast, treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy.	[[86, 89]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml

10576	A third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9–14 (Figure 6C), but died of a severe bacterial infection, with no evidence of ongoing EBOV infection, on day 16 (Figure 6B, unpublished data).

10579	Since the VP35 PMO alone did not provide any protection to nonhuman primates, these data suggest that a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment and also suggests that protection in the combination PMO-treated monkeys is not due to nonspecific effects of PMO administration..

10587	Importantly, PMO administration did not induce early (0–2 dpi) detectable serum IFN, TNF, or other cytokines in the nonhuman primates (unpublished data), indicating that the protection was likely not due to nonspecific effects via induction of innate immunity.

10589	By 28 d after EBOV challenge, the surviving rhesus monkeys had high levels of both anti-EBOV antibodies and T cell responses, similar to the PMO-protected mice (unpublished data)..	[[14, 18], [88, 92], [141, 144]]	[]	['EBOV', 'EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10590	Our current studies indicate the effectiveness of PMOs targeted to specific EBOV mRNAs against in vitro, rodent, and nonhuman primate EBOV infections.	[[76, 80], [134, 138], [50, 53]]	[]	['EBOV', 'EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10591	The data presented here are in line with our working hypothesis that a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance..	[[133, 137], [86, 89]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10592	Cell-free experiments demonstrated that the EBOV-specific PMOs were efficient at inhibiting EBOV mRNA translation and that MARV-specific PMOs had no effect on translation of corresponding EBOV genes.	[[44, 48], [92, 96], [188, 192], [123, 127], [58, 61], [137, 140]]	[]	['EBOV', 'EBOV', 'EBOV', 'MARV', 'PMO', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10593	While the reporter-based in vitro assays appeared to be good indicators of sequence-specific activity of PMOs, it seems that in the case of EBOV, the in vitro translation assays were not fully predictive of the rodent efficacy data.	[[140, 144], [105, 108]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10594	Using VeroE6 cells we showed that EBOV replication was moderately suppressed in cells treated with EBOV-specific PMOs.	[[34, 38], [99, 103], [113, 116]]	[]	['EBOV', 'EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10595	However, no visible difference was observed when comparing the ability of a single PMO and the combination of three PMOs to reduce viral growth.	[[83, 86], [116, 119]]	[]	['PMO', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10596	The PMOs used in these studies were not conjugated with peptides that facilitate cellular uptake.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10597	We have observed lower cellular uptake of naked PMOs compared with peptide-conjugated PMOs by Vero E6 cells (unpublished data), and this may explain the moderate inhibition observed in the in vitro replication assay.	[[48, 51], [86, 89]]	[]	['PMO', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10598	Nonetheless, the data summarized in Figure 1 clearly indicate the feasibility of specific gene targeting by unconjugated PMO and the favorable antiviral activity of these compounds..	[[121, 124]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10599	We hypothesize that the efficacy of this strategy relies on the ability of PMOs, by reducing viral replication, to create a window of opportunity for the immune system to clear the otherwise lethal infection.	[[75, 78]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10600	This approach does not result in sterile protection, as evidenced by the robust anti-EBOV immune responses in the surviving mice and nonhuman primates, and by the mild clinical signs (thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevations, depression, and lethargy) observed in the PMO-treated monkeys.	[[85, 89], [269, 272]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10601	It is likely that successful treatment of patients infected with EBOV will require a multifaceted approach consisting of an antiviral, and therapeutics for symptom and disease management [1,9]..	[[65, 69]]	[]	['EBOV']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10602	Post-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents, and, presumably, this is explained by the pharmacokinetic properties of PMO.	[[67, 71], [29, 32]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10603	Following parenteral injection, PMOs are cleared from the bloodstream within hours, but accumulate and remain within tissues such as spleen and liver for days (unpublished data).	[[32, 35]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10604	By administering PMO after challenge, it is likely that higher concentrations were available in the circulation and tissues during the peak of viral replication.	[[17, 20]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10605	Thus, the PMOs may have been able to reduce amplification of EBOV during this critical timeframe, allowing development of appropriate host immune responses to the otherwise lethal viral infection [27–29].	[[61, 65], [10, 13]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10606	Since effective treatment seemed to require critical timing of PMO administration, and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to EBOV infection, we decided to both pretreat and administer daily doses of PMOs after viral challenge in the proof-of-concept nonhuman primate studies.	[[129, 133], [63, 66], [203, 206]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10607	Along these lines, future studies may show that the pharmacokinetics of PMO can be enhanced by other modifications or alternative routes of administration or regimen to improve efficacy..	[[72, 75]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10608	In order to corroborate the in vitro data and narrow down the number of antiviral lead candidates, the EBOV mouse model was an obvious choice for testing multiple candidate PMOs [30].	[[103, 107], [173, 176]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10609	While the mouse model has several differences in pathogenesis compared with EBOV infection of nonhuman primates and humans [31–33], it is widely accepted as an appropriate model for rapid testing of potential antivirals before proceeding to NHP trials.

10611	This proof-of-principle study using PMOs demonstrates favorable anti-EBOV activity both in vitro and in vivo; thus, these molecules represent a pool of potential lead compounds for further evaluation and optimization.	[[69, 73], [36, 39]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10612	Future studies will focus on determining the most favorable PMO dose and regimen and also the therapeutic potential of these molecules.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10613	Additionally, antisense PMO designed to target other regions within the EBOV genome will be pursued.	[[72, 76], [24, 27]]	[]	['EBOV', 'PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml
10614	Genetically designed microbial therapeutics, such as antisense PMOs or other sequence-based approaches, allow quick hit-to-lead optimization and may accelerate time-to-drug development.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['PMO']	[]	PMC1326218.nxml

10658	Instead, extracellular pathogen recognition is mediated by two known classes of PRRs that lack intracellular kinase domains, serine-threonine receptor kinases and receptor-like proteins (RLPs).	[[80, 83], [187, 190]]	[[163, 185]]	['PRR', 'RLP']	['receptor-like proteins']	PMC1331981.nxml

10660	Mammals contain at least three classes of intracellular PRRs: TLRs [11], nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors [23–25], and two kinases, protein kinase R (PKR) [26] and RNAseL [27], that directly or indirectly detect virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).

10664	A more recently described class of PRRs is the NOD receptors, which are known to detect bacterial pathogens.	[[47, 50], [35, 38]]	[]	['NOD', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10665	RIP2 kinase (also known as RICK and CARDIAC) interacts directly with NOD1 [23] and NOD2 [24] and is required for the activation of NF-κB [25].	[[131, 136]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10667	Intracellular recognition of plant pathogens is carried out by NOD receptors (more commonly referred to as nucleotide binding site leucine-rich receptors [NBS-LRRs]) that have been long known to confer strain-specific resistance to numerous viral, bacterial, fungal, and nematode pathogens.

10672	We surveyed the complement of non-RD kinases among the yeast, fly, worm, human, Arabidopsis, and rice genomes and found that, while less than 20% of all kinases are non-RD, all six plant PRR kinases and six of nine animal PRR-associated cytoplasmic kinases that are known or predicted to transmit PRR signals are non-RD.

10681	We found that six of nine kinases known or predicted to associate with PRRs and relay PRR signals were non-RD.	[[71, 74], [86, 89]]	[]	['PRR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10682	Five non-RD kinases in the IRAK and RIP families and one kinase in the “Other” group were found to play prominent roles in early steps of innate immunity pathways (Figure 1, Table 4).	[[27, 31], [36, 39]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10683	These include IRAK1 [38], Pelle [39], RIP1 [13], and RIP2 [12], which directly associate with NOD and/or TLR type PRRs and play primary roles in signaling (see [40] and [41] for reviews on IRAK and RIP kinases).

10684	One additional RIP family member, RIP4, has been shown to activate NF-κB when overexpressed [42].	[[67, 72], [15, 18]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10685	The sixth non-RD kinase, RNAseL, falls into the group “Other” and indirectly responds to viral dsRNA [27].	[[95, 100]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10686	The three exceptions, IRAK2 (an ACF kinase), IRAK4 (RD) and PKR (RD), have unique or limited roles in PRR signaling.	[[32, 35], [60, 63], [102, 105]]	[]	['ACF', 'PKR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10687	IRAK2 and IRAK4 have a limited ability to propagate PRR signals and/or need non-RD kinases to function.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10688	For example, IRAK4 is capable of only weak NF-κB activation in the absence of IRAK1 and is thought to recruit IRAK1 to the PRR complex, where IRAK1 becomes activated and leaves the receptor complex to facilitate downstream signaling [43,44].	[[43, 48], [123, 126]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10689	IRAK2 [45] is catalytically inactive and mediates NF-κB activation via a MAL/TIRAP (Myd88 adaptor-like protein) that functions in a cell-specific manner to partially control TLR-4 responses [46].	[[50, 55], [174, 177]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'TLR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10690	Unlike its human homolog, mouse IRAK2 does not appear to play a role in NF-κB activation [47], and two splice variants of mouse Irak2 were found to function as negative regulators of innate immune responses [48].	[[72, 77]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10691	Similarly, PKR, like RNAseL, responds to viral dsRNA; however, PKR kinase activity is not needed to trigger NF-κB activation, suggesting that this function of PKR may be mediated by other proteins such as a non-RD kinase [49].	[[47, 52], [108, 113], [11, 14], [63, 66], [159, 162]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'NF-κB', 'PKR', 'PKR', 'PKR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10692	Of the remaining four IRAK and RIP kinases in humans, three have unknown functions (RIP5 and 6 [non-RD] and RIP7 [RD]) [41] and two act as negative regulators of TLR signaling (IRAK3/IRAKM [ACF] and RIP3 [RD]) [50–52].	[[22, 26], [31, 34], [162, 165]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RIP', 'TLR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10693	Taken together, all NOD- and TLR-type animal PRRs appear to associate with and utilize non-RD IRAK and/or RIP kinases to activate NF-κB pathways, whereas RD and ACF kinases appear to play ancillary roles in signaling..

10694	A number of non-PRR receptor-mediated pathways are also known to activate NF-κB in humans, including the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family of receptors, which play critical roles in apoptotic signaling as well as in innate and adaptive immune responses (reviewed in [53]), and the epidermal growth factor receptor [54].	[[74, 79], [16, 19], [137, 141]]	[[105, 135]]	['NF-κB', 'PRR', 'TNFR']	['tumor necrosis factor receptor']	PMC1331981.nxml
10695	The non-RD kinases IRAK1, RIP1, COT/Tpl-2, and death-associated protein kinase associate with TNFR complexes via TNFR-associated factor, TNFR-associated death domain, and Fas-associated death domain adaptor proteins [55–57].	[[94, 98], [113, 117], [137, 141]]	[]	['TNFR', 'TNFR', 'TNFR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10696	Similarly, the epidermal growth factor receptor associates with the non-RD kinases RIP1 and NF-κB-inducing kinase; however, unlike TNFRs, it does not appear to require TNFR-associated death domain or Fas-associated death domain adaptor proteins [54].	[[92, 97], [131, 135], [168, 172]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'TNFR', 'TNFR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10697	Most RIP, IRAK, and death-associated protein kinases, with the exception of RIP3–7, share a common domain in the death domain superfamily that includes the death domain, death effector domain, and caspase recruitment domain [58].	[[10, 14], [5, 8]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10698	Therefore, in addition to known PRR-mediated innate immunity pathways, other receptor-mediated pathways leading to NF-κB activation in humans also utilize non-RD kinases..	[[115, 120], [32, 35]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10699	A survey of IRAK family receptor kinases in plants revealed a perfect correlation between those that function in innate immunity and non-RD motifs (Table 5).	[[12, 16]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10700	Out of 38 receptor kinases with known or implied functions, six are known or presumed to function in disease resistance and act as PRRs.	[[131, 134]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10701	The remaining 32 receptor kinases are RD or ACF kinases that function in a wide variety of signaling pathways, including development, pollen recognition, steroid perception, stress/pathogen responses, and interactions with symbiotic organisms.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['ACF']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10702	Two RD kinases, ERECTA [62] and WAKL22 [63], have been found to incrementally contribute to pathogen resistance in addition to their known roles in development; however, these receptor kinases are not known to function as PRRs, and both ERECTA and WAKL22 were identified as components of quantitative trait loci.	[[222, 225]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10703	Therefore, although diverse IRAK family kinases control many cellular processes in plants, it is clear that as with animal systems, plant PRRs utilize non-RD kinases..	[[28, 32], [138, 141]]	[]	['IRAK', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10704	In contrast to animals, plant IRAK family cytoplasmic kinases are not known to associate with and directly relay PRR signals.	[[30, 34], [113, 116]]	[]	['IRAK', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10705	Of the 22 receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamilies in rice and Arabidopsis (Table S6), only three kinases have been linked to pathogen recognition.	[[44, 48]]	[[10, 42]]	['RLCK']	['receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase']	PMC1331981.nxml
10706	PTO and PBS1 are RD kinases that function in concert with the NOD-like NBS-LRR receptors PRF and RPS5, respectively, and provide resistance against bacterial pathogens.	[[75, 78], [71, 78], [62, 65]]	[]	['LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'NOD']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10707	Rather than functioning to relay PRR signals, PTO [64] and PBS1 [30] are thought to be the targets of bacterial effector proteins.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10708	A third RLCK, RPG1, contains dual kinase domains (one non-RD and one ACF) and functions in perception of a fungal pathogen [65].	[[69, 72], [8, 12]]	[]	['ACF', 'RLCK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10709	To date, it is not known if RPG1 also requires NBS-LRR receptors to trigger innate immune responses or if RPG1 associates with an RLP.	[[51, 54], [47, 54]]	[]	['LRR', 'NBS-LRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10710	Although it has been repeatedly speculated that RLP-family PRRs that lack kinase domains, such as XA21D [20] or Cf-9 [19], transmit signals via receptor kinase or cytoplasmic kinase partners, such partners have not yet been confirmed.	[[59, 62], [48, 51]]	[]	['PRR', 'RLP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10711	Potential candidates include those RLCK family kinases with non-RD domains.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['RLCK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10723	A comparative study of Arabidopsis and rice indicated that IRAK family kinases associated with defense responses have undergone lineage-specific expansions due to both tandem and large scale duplications within the genomes, in some cases resulting in large subfamilies (over 100 kinases) [10].	[[59, 63]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10724	For example, the LRR XII subfamily that includes the PRRs XA21 and FLS2 contains over 100 members in rice and only eight in Arabidopsis.	[[17, 20], [53, 56]]	[]	['LRR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10726	In contrast, IRAK family kinases associated with development have remained largely unchanged since the last common ancestor of these two highly divergent plant species [10].	[[13, 17]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10729	Using new data from the assembled Japonica rice genome, we analyzed the composition and chromosomal distribution of all rice and Arabidopsis IRAK kinase subfamilies and selected them based on the following criteria: at least eight members within the subfamily, lineage-specific expansion (i.e., expansion in rice and/or Arabidopsis), and at least one cluster of four or more closely related genes as defined by Holub (Tables S6, S8, and S9) [67].

10732	In total, rice contains 456 more IRAK family kinases than Arabidopsis, and expanded non-RD kinase subfamilies accounted for 69% of this difference (313 of the 456).	[[33, 37]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10733	Expanded non-RD subfamilies included all known PRR kinases: XA21 [18], Xa26 [59], FLS2 [17], and Pi-2d [X.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10735	Furthermore, all seven non-RD IRAK family receptor kinase subfamilies in rice, and two of three in Arabidopsis, show recent lineage specific expansions.	[[30, 34]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10736	This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that non-RD IRAK subfamilies in plants function in pathogen recognition and innate immunity..	[[59, 63]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10737	Most IRAK family kinases in animals have known roles in innate immunity.	[[5, 9]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10740	Additionally, kinases with functions analogous to IRAKs, such as those in the RIP family, also commonly contain non-RD motifs..	[[50, 54], [78, 81]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10741	We found that non-RD PRR kinase subfamilies have evolutionary expansion patterns consistent with the NBS-LRR class of PRRs and show lineage-specific expansions marked by tandem duplications.	[[105, 108], [101, 108], [21, 24], [118, 121]]	[]	['LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'PRR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10742	Recently, a similar analysis demonstrated that the RLP class of PRRs (extracellular receptors that lack kinase domains) show these same expansionary patterns [69].	[[64, 67], [51, 54]]	[]	['PRR', 'RLP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10743	Known PRR kinase subfamilies were three to 12 times larger in rice than in Arabidopsis.	[[6, 9]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10745	This is also consistent with the fact that only two IRAK family receptors are known or predicted to confer disease resistance in Arabidopsis (FLS2 and PR5K) [17,60], whereas rice and other monocots contain at least five [18,65,59,61, [X.	[[52, 56]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml

10749	Similarly, counterparts of flowering plant NOD-like NBS-LRRs found in the more primitive mosses contain a unique ACF kinase domain that falls within the IRAK family [71].	[[113, 116], [153, 157], [56, 59], [52, 59], [43, 46]]	[]	['ACF', 'IRAK', 'LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'NOD']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10750	This kinase-NBS-LRR structure has not been found in flowering plants, suggesting that modern plant NBS-LRRs may have lost the associated kinase.	[[16, 19], [103, 106], [12, 19], [99, 106]]	[]	['LRR', 'LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'NBS-LRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10751	Similarly, the RLP XA21D contains a truncation that results in deletion of the non-RD kinase domain.	[[15, 18]]	[]	['RLP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10752	The observation that kinases have been lost from or added to PRR-mediated pathways may also underscore the role of these kinases in signaling.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10753	In other instances, such as the Drosophila IMD pathway and plant NBS-LRRs and RLPs, assembly of signaling complexes may have evolved to occur in the absence of kinases altogether, hence the lack of these domains [20]..	[[69, 72], [65, 72], [78, 81]]	[]	['LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'RLP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10754	Although IRAK, Pelle, and plant receptor kinases are monophyletic (with respect to other kinase families), they fall into distinct clades.	[[9, 13]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10755	Therefore, IRAK1 and Pelle are not more similar to FLS2 or XA21 than they are to plant IRAK family kinases that control nondefense pathways, such as SYMRK or BRI1 (Table S7).	[[87, 91]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10756	In plants, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the PRR subfamilies LRR-XII (FLS2/XA21), SD-2b (PI-2D), and the putative PRR subfamilies LRK10L-2 (LRK10/PR5K) and RLCK-OS2 (similar to RPG1) may have evolved independently to function in innate immunity.

10757	The prevalence of non-RD kinases in PRRs and PRR complexes does, however, imply that RD kinases may not be ideally suited to control some of the early signaling events that lead to activation of NF-κB in animals and defense responses in plants.	[[195, 200], [36, 39], [45, 48]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'PRR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10758	In mammals, precise control of NF-κB pathways is essential, as persistent activation results in chronic inflammatory syndromes and malignancies [77].	[[31, 36]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10759	This may also explain the apparent loss of PRR-linked kinases in the Drosophila IMD and plant NBS-LRR pathways, as well as the presence of some catalytically inactive IRAK family members in humans..	[[167, 171], [98, 101], [94, 101], [43, 46]]	[]	['IRAK', 'LRR', 'NBS-LRR', 'PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10760	This is also true for a small number of RD kinases, such as the transforming growth factor-β receptor II kinase domain [80], which maintains a constitutively active configuration through neutralization of the arginine by negatively charged amino acids in the activation loop, and the NFR5 and SYM10 plant IRAK family kinases that lack the activation loop [81].	[[305, 309]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10761	This function, or lack thereof, has apparently been retained in at least some IRAK family non-RD kinases.	[[78, 82]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10762	In vitro studies have shown that despite the presence of a highly conserved threonine (five amino acids prior to the subdomain VIII motif APE), the activation loop of the rice PRR kinase XA21 is not autophosphorylated [35].	[[176, 179]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10763	Activation loop phosphorylation was found only in RD and ACF kinases, although non-RD kinases were not well represented in this sample..	[[57, 60]]	[]	['ACF']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10764	Despite indications that the activation loop is not autophosphorylated in some IRAK family non-RD kinases, we found that the highly conserved activation loop threonine is still conserved, indicating that this residue likely plays an important role (unpublished data).	[[79, 83]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10765	Recent data suggest that activation of human IRAK1 [14] and plant IRAK family kinases require this threonine; however, thus far it has only been confirmed as an autophosphorylation site in the plant RD kinases BRI1 [83], BAK1 [83], and SYMRK [84].	[[66, 70]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10766	Not surprisingly, some IRAK family kinases appear to utilize alternative regulatory mechanisms.	[[23, 27]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10767	This residue was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro in IRAK1 and XA21 and was identified as an in vivo site in BRI1; however, mutation to alanine only affected the activities of IRAK, XA21, and SYMRK.	[[179, 183]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10768	With the absence of known structures for any IRAK family kinases, structural studies and further phosphorylation site mapping are needed to illuminate the potential functional significance of changes to the RD motif..	[[45, 49]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10769	Likewise, the conserved threonine in the activation loop of the non-RD kinase COT was shown to be constitutively transphosphorylated by an unknown kinase in vivo and was required for both robust kinase activity and activation of NF-κB pathways [85].	[[229, 234]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10770	Therefore, in some non-RD kinases transphosphorylation of the activation loop can alter catalytic activity, but whether this occurs in PRR kinases and how it might relate to signaling remain unclear..	[[135, 138]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10771	The correlation between non-RD kinases in the IRAK and RIP families and innate immunity provides a predictive tool for the functions of unknown IRAK and RIP kinases (currently over 400), the vast majority of which are plant IRAK family kinases.	[[46, 50], [144, 148], [224, 228], [55, 58], [153, 156]]	[]	['IRAK', 'IRAK', 'IRAK', 'RIP', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10772	For example, during the course of this study, we were able to predict that the RD kinases IRAK4 [44] and RIP3 [53] would have distinct roles (as compared to IRAK1 and RIP1, respectively) in PRR signaling before their putative functions were published.	[[190, 193]]	[]	['PRR']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10773	Our analysis also predicts that the Caenorhabditis elegans IRAK family kinase PIK-1 has a likely role in regulating innate immune pathways despite unsuccessful attempts to demonstrate such a role [86].	[[59, 63]]	[]	['IRAK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10774	Similarly, a number of unknown plant IRAK subfamilies can also be predicted to play roles in innate immunity, such as the SD-2a, SD-2b, WAKa, WAKc, RLCK-OS2, and WAKL-OS subfamilies.	[[37, 41], [148, 152]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RLCK']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10775	We also noted that, although the two human kinases SgK496 and SgK288 have both been referred to as RIP5, SgK496 does not appear to fall within the RIP or IRAK subfamilies [41].	[[154, 158], [147, 150]]	[]	['IRAK', 'RIP']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10776	The three subdomains (II, VI, VII) for each RD, non-RD, and ACF kinase are available in Tables S1, S2, and S3.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['ACF']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10777	Subfamilies were classified as being predominantly RD, non-RD, or ACF if more than 70% of the kinases fell into one class (Table S6).	[[66, 69]]	[]	['ACF']	[]	PMC1331981.nxml
10778	This was true for all but five subfamilies (RLCK XV, URKI, DUF26-1h, RLCK-OS1, RLCK IXb), which were classified as “mixed.” A large number of kinases in rice and Arabidopsis were classified as ACF, because these genes encoded protein kinase fragments.

10791	monocytogenes invasion and replication within the gastrointestinal tract is independent of InlA and is restricted to the Peyer's patches, suggesting a predominant role for specialized phagocytic M-cells in bacterial uptake [13,25–28].	[[91, 95]]	[]	['InlA']	[]	PMC1354196.nxml
10792	Similarly in rats, intestinal translocation rates are low and independent of the inlAB locus, suggesting a passive process that does not involve InlA or InlB [29].	[[145, 149], [153, 157]]	[]	['InlA', 'InlB']	[]	PMC1354196.nxml
10793	Furthermore, mouse and rat E-cadherin differ from human E-cadherin at an important amino acid residue that renders cells resistant to InlA-mediated invasion [13].	[[134, 138]]	[]	['InlA']	[]	PMC1354196.nxml

10797	Moreover, canine E-cadherin is identical to human E-cadherin in the critical InlA binding region, and InlB activates c-Met signaling in MDCK cells [14].	[[77, 81], [102, 106], [136, 140]]	[]	['InlA', 'InlB', 'MDCK']	[]	PMC1354196.nxml

10904	Inasmuch as the ITP GAS were isolated from cases of invasive disease, we hypothesized that ITP GAS may be derived from PTP GAS during invasive infections.	[[20, 23], [95, 98], [123, 126], [16, 19], [91, 94], [119, 122]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10906	Colony morphology was used as an initial indicator of transcriptional profile because PTP GAS are nonmucoid, whereas ITP GAS are mucoid.	[[90, 93], [121, 124], [117, 120], [86, 89]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10910	More important, although all GAS isolated from the skin lesions of mice infected with the ITP strain also were mucoid, colonies grown from the skin lesions of PTP-infected mice were a mixture of nonmucoid parental and mucoid variant strains at approximately 1:1 ratio (Figure S2)..

10914	Assays of culture supernatant SPN enzymatic activity further supported the idea that ITP GAS can be derived from PTP GAS during invasive infections (Figure S3)..	[[89, 92], [117, 120], [85, 88], [113, 116], [30, 33]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP', 'SPN']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10917	Transcriptome differences between strain MGAS2221 and ITP mouse-passaged derivatives correlated strongly with those observed for clinical PTP and ITP isolates (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.76; Figure S4), further confirming the ability of M1 GAS to transition from PTP to ITP during an invasive infection..

10918	To determine whether ITP and PTP GAS differed in ability to cause invasive disease, isolates were compared in mouse models of bacteremia and soft-tissue infection.	[[33, 36], [21, 24], [29, 32]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10920	ITP GAS were significantly more virulent than PTP GAS in this model of infection (p < 0.0001, logrank test; Figure 3A)..	[[4, 7], [50, 53], [46, 49]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10921	Next, the virulence of these eight ITP and PTP strains was compared in a mouse model of soft-tissue infection.	[[35, 38], [43, 46]]	[]	['ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10922	The average lesion volumes over time were significantly greater for mice infected with the PTP organisms than ITP GAS (Figure 3B).	[[114, 117], [110, 113], [91, 94]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10923	Thus, in contrast to the bacteremia model data, the soft-tissue infection study identified PTP GAS as being more virulent than ITP GAS, as assessed by lesion volume.	[[95, 98], [131, 134], [127, 130], [91, 94]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10925	Thus, it appears that the two distinct transcriptomes of GAS bestow differential virulence, with ITP GAS having increased virulence in bacteremia, and PTP GAS having increased virulence in soft-tissue infections..

10932	The PTP strain MGAS2221 and its mouse-passaged ITP derivative strain 26PL1 had 20 common genetic changes relative to the genome of strain MGAS5005 (Table 1).	[[47, 50], [4, 7]]	[]	['ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

10937	To further examine the association of covR/S mutations with transcriptome profile, we sequenced these two genes from 42 M1 GAS isolates (15 clinical and 27 mouse-passaged derivatives of strains MGAS5005 and MGAS2221).	[[123, 126]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10938	All PTP isolates had wild-type covR/S genes.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10939	In striking contrast, all ITP isolates had either a mutated covR or covS gene (Table S1).	[[26, 29]]	[]	['ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10940	The results above suggested that mutation of covR or covS was the molecular mechanism responsible for PTP to ITP transition in GAS.	[[109, 112], [102, 105]]	[]	['ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10941	Transformation of strain MGAS5005 with plasmid pDC123 did not affect the secreted protein pattern, as determined by Western immunoblots assaying SpeA, SpeB, SLO/SPN, Mac, and Spd3 reactivity (Figure 5).	[[175, 179], [161, 164]]	[]	['Spd3', 'SPN']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10942	In contrast, introduction of pDC123 encoding CovS into strain MGAS5005 converted the secretion pattern to one that was identical to PTP GAS isolates.	[[136, 139], [132, 135]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10943	Full (strain MGAS6184) or partial (strain MGAS294) complementation was also observed following introduction of the CovS encoding plasmid into two additional clinical ITP GAS strains (unpublished data).	[[170, 173], [166, 169]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10944	These data provide strong evidence that the transcriptome profile of GAS is intimately linked to the allelic state of covR/S..	[[69, 72]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10945	Passage of GAS in human blood ex vivo or through mice has long been known to produce strain derivatives with enhanced virulence.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10946	This strain variation also is observed among GAS clinical isolates, thereby raising the possibility that such variation is an important contributor to disease outcome.	[[45, 48]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10947	We used expression microarray and genome resequencing to characterize transcriptome differences in GAS variants and identify the underlying molecular mechanism.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10948	We discovered that a single 7-bp insertion mutation in the gene encoding the sensor kinase component of a TCS was solely responsible for the tremendous number of transcript differences distinguishing a PTP isolate from its ITP derivative..	[[223, 226], [202, 205], [106, 109]]	[]	['ITP', 'PTP', 'TCS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10949	ITP and PTP GAS strains have very distinct transcriptomes and cause significantly different disease manifestations (Figures 1 and 3).	[[12, 15], [8, 11]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10950	The increased virulence of ITP GAS in the bacteremia model was linked to up-regulation of many factors that inhibit PMN function, including capsule, Sic, Mac, streptococcal DNase D2, C5a peptidase, S.	[[31, 34], [27, 30], [116, 119]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PMN']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10951	Increased production of these virulence factors by ITP GAS occurs concurrently with decreased production of SpeB, a broad-spectrum cysteine protease virulence factor (Figure 2A [28–30]).	[[55, 58], [51, 54]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10952	More important, SpeB also cleaves and inactivates bacterial proteins that contribute to host–pathogen interactions, including many cell-wall anchored and secreted GAS virulence factors such as M protein [32].	[[163, 166]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10953	Hence, despite the modest (1.16-fold) increase in emm transcription in ITP strains (Figure S1), the relative amount of mature M protein may be significantly greater for ITP strains because of the SpeB-mediated degradation of M protein by PTP GAS.	[[71, 74], [169, 172], [238, 241]]	[]	['ITP', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10954	Thus, decreased SpeB production may play a key role in the increased lethality of ITP GAS by preserving GAS virulence factors [30,32,33].	[[86, 89], [104, 107], [82, 85]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10955	Indeed, an inverse correlation between in vitro SpeB expression and human disease severity has been observed for contemporary M1 GAS [9].	[[129, 132]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10956	Indeed, despite minimal in vitro SpeB expression by the highly virulent ITP strain MGAS5005, this strain produces extensive amounts of SpeB when grown ex vivo in human saliva [34]..	[[72, 75]]	[]	['ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10957	Mice infected subcutaneously with PTP GAS had significantly larger skin lesions than animals injected with ITP strains (all of which were covS −), an unexpected finding given a previous report of increased lesion formation by a covS mutant strain (Figure 3B [21]).	[[38, 41], [107, 110], [34, 37]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10958	It is possible that the 2-fold increase in transcription of the sag operon (encoding streptolysin S) by PTP isolates is one contributory factor for the larger lesion volumes observed following PTP GAS infection (Figures 1B and 3B).	[[197, 200], [104, 107], [193, 196]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10959	Streptolysin S is known to cause epithelial cell cytotoxicity, impede phagocytic clearance of GAS, and promote tissue necrosis [35,36].	[[94, 97]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10960	It should be noted, however, that no difference was observed between four ITP and four PTP GAS strains following determination of hemolytic zone size after plating on blood agar plates (unpublished data)..	[[91, 94], [74, 77], [87, 90]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10961	Transcription of the genes encoding streptokinase (ska), Mac (mac), and capsule production (the has operon) are repressed by CovRS [16–18,25], providing an explanation for the increased expression of these genes by ITP GAS strains.	[[219, 222], [215, 218]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10962	This regulatory RNA positively regulates the expression of several GAS virulence factor-encoding genes including sic, nga, emm, and ska.	[[67, 70]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10963	As sagA transcription is increased in PTP GAS strains this would be expected to lead to increased transcription of sic, nga, emm, and ska.	[[42, 45], [38, 41]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10964	However, transcription of these genes is decreased in comparison to ITP GAS (Figure 1B).	[[72, 75], [68, 71]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10965	We believe that this observation highlights the hierarchy and extensive cross-talking that occurs between GAS transcriptional regulators.	[[106, 109]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10966	That is, we believe that despite a greater concentration of sagA RNA in PTP GAS strains (sagA++, covR/S +), the transcription of sic, nga, and ska are repressed compared to ITP GAS (sagA+, covR/S −) due to CovRS-mediated repression..	[[76, 79], [177, 180], [173, 176], [72, 75]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10967	As rgg transcription is 3.8-fold higher in PTP GAS, the increase in speB and grab transcription and decrease in slo and mac transcription by PTP GAS isolates may at least be partially mediated through greater Rgg activity..	[[47, 50], [145, 148], [43, 46], [141, 144]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'PTP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10968	Genome resequencing found that only a single 7-bp insertion mutation in covS differentiated PTP strain MGAS2221 from its ITP derivative (strain 26PL1), an unexpected finding given the extensive differences in transcriptome, exoproteome, and mouse virulence between these strains.	[[121, 124], [92, 95]]	[]	['ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10969	Thus, the resequencing microarrays used in this study were powerful tools to identify genetic differences between GAS strains at a whole genome level.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10970	Even if genomic alterations were missed in our study, the strong correlation between GAS transcriptional profile and covR/S genotype, coupled with covR/S complementation data, strongly supports the notion that mutation of covR/S is sufficient for transition from PTP to ITP..	[[85, 88], [270, 273], [263, 266]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10971	We hypothesize that PTP GAS are preferentially suited for survival in the human pharynx.	[[24, 27], [20, 23]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10972	[40] have reported that binding of SpeB to the GAS cell surface protects the pathogen from killing by LL-37 by targeted degradation of this antibacterial factor.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10973	In this regard, we note that the gene encoding GRAB, a GAS cell-surface protein that tethers α-2-macroglobulin to the bacterial cell surface, is itself up-regulated approximately 8-fold in PTP isolates (Figure 1B [41]).	[[55, 58], [189, 192]]	[]	['GAS', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10974	Thus, coordinated up-regulation of SpeB and GRAB likely enhance survival of GAS in the upper respiratory tract..	[[76, 79]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10975	ITP GAS arise from PTP precursors during invasive infections (Figures 2 and S2), presumably due in part to their increased ability to escape PMN-mediated killing (Figure 4).	[[4, 7], [141, 144], [19, 22]]	[]	['GAS', 'PMN', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10976	Since several of the antiphagocytic effectors made by ITP strains are freely diffusible, PTP GAS present at the infection site with ITP organisms might profit from a “bystander” effect.	[[93, 96], [54, 57], [132, 135], [89, 92]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10977	We have not obtained evidence that ITP GAS can convert to a PTP form.	[[39, 42], [35, 38], [60, 63]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10978	Similarly, we did not recover PTP GAS from the upper respiratory tract of nonhuman primates with experimental GAS pharyngitis induced by an ITP strain [26] (unpublished data).	[[34, 37], [110, 113], [140, 143], [30, 33]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10979	These observations, coupled with the fact that many distinct covR/S mutations were found in different ITP isolates, lead us to conclude that the PTP to ITP conversion is largely unidirectional.	[[102, 105], [152, 155], [145, 148]]	[]	['ITP', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10980	However, we cannot rule out the possibility that transition of ITP to PTP GAS occurs at a very low frequency due to back or second-site mutations..	[[74, 77], [63, 66], [70, 73]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10981	Following the assumption that infecting GAS is a homogeneous population, clinical diagnostic laboratories generally retain only one or a small number of colonies from each infected patient.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10982	However, the data presented herein found that both ITP and PTP GAS can be recovered from an invasive infection (Figure S2).	[[63, 66], [51, 54], [59, 62]]	[]	['GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10983	Thus, this observation may help to explain the imperfect correlations between GAS phenotypic variation and disease source seen in this and other studies (Table S1).	[[78, 81]]	[]	['GAS']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml
10984	Isolation of PTP GAS from an invasive infection does not preclude ITP GAS from also playing an important role..	[[17, 20], [70, 73], [66, 69], [13, 16]]	[]	['GAS', 'GAS', 'ITP', 'PTP']	[]	PMC1354197.nxml

11058	It should be noted that the bacteria were grown at 26 °C in the presence of calcium prior to infection to keep the Ysc-Yop TTSS repressed and minimize the potential cytotoxic effects of Yops on the macrophages [39].	[[123, 127]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml

11066	Since the ΔBA strain exhibited severe delays in host cell cytotoxicity, we reasoned that these mutants might have defects in Yop secretion or synthesis.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml

11068	Conversely, the ΔBA cells exhibited severe defects in secretion of Yops in the absence of calcium (Figure 6, lane 3), suggesting that the SmpB-SsrA system plays an important role in affecting the expression of the Yersinia TTSS.	[[16, 19]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11069	These results suggest that the ΔBA strain possesses a compromised TTSS that may function suboptimally.	[[31, 34], [66, 70]]	[]	['ΔBA', 'TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11070	A compromised/less efficient TTSS could account for the decreased Yop secretion phenotype of the ΔBA strain observed in the infection assays.	[[97, 100], [29, 33]]	[]	['ΔBA', 'TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11071	The secretion defect of ΔBA strain could be fully complemented by a plasmid (psmpB-ssrA) expressing the smpB-ssrA genes under their native promoters (Figure 6, lane 4).	[[24, 27]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11072	One possible explanation for the drastic reduction in the secretion of Yops in the ΔBA cells might be a decrease in endogenous levels of Ysc-Yop system proteins.	[[83, 86]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11073	To test this hypothesis, we used Western blot analysis to examine the endogenous levels of TTSS components in whole-cell lysates of wild-type and mutant strains grown under inducing conditions, at 37 °C in the absence of calcium.	[[91, 95]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11074	This analysis revealed a decrease in endogenous protein levels of several TTSS components, most notably YopD, YopB, LcrH, and LcrV (Figure 7).	[[74, 78]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11075	The decrease in protein expression levels of YopB, YopD, and LcrV could partially explain the overall decrease in secretion of the effector Yops by the ΔBA mutant..	[[152, 155]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11076	There are a number of possible reasons for the observed reduction in the intracellular levels of YopB, YopD, and LcrV in the ΔBA mutant, including reduced transcription, enhanced mRNA degradation, reduced translation, or enhanced proteolysis.	[[125, 128]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11077	To further investigate the reason for this decrease, total RNA from the wild-type and isogenic ΔBA mutant strains were isolated after 1 h of cell growth at 37 °C in the absence of calcium and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR.	[[95, 98]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11078	Consistent with the real-time PCR data, Northern blot analysis of total cellular mRNA from wild-type and mutant bacteria revealed reduced levels of yopB mRNA in ΔBA cells (Figure 8B).	[[161, 164]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11079	These results mirror the observed Yop synthesis and secretion phenotypes of the ΔBA mutant cells described thus far and provide further evidence for an important role played by the SmpB-SsrA system in expression of the Ysc-Yop TTSS in Y.	[[80, 83], [227, 231]]	[]	['ΔBA', 'TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11080	Transcription of the Ysc-Yop TTSS is regulated by both temperature and extracellular calcium [42–45], and requires the VirF (LcrF) protein, a member of the AraC family of transcriptional activators [46].	[[29, 33]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11081	This analysis showed that in the wild-type strain, VirF protein level increases dramatically upon induction of the TTSS (Figure 9A, lanes 1 and 3).	[[115, 119]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11082	Furthermore, these results indicate that in the smpB-ssrA mutant strain, the Ysc-Yop TTSS remains in a transcriptionally repressed state under both secretion non-permissive and permissive conditions..	[[85, 89]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11083	The Ysc-Yop and flagellar TTSSs are thought to be evolutionarily related [52,53].	[[26, 30]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11084	In stark contrast, the ΔBA mutant cells had impaired motility and thus were unable to move from the point of inoculation (Figure 10A).	[[23, 26]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11085	As expected, the majority of the wild-type cells carried flagella; however, most, if not all, of the ΔBA cells lacked intact flagella (Figure 10B).	[[101, 104]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11086	To determine the percentage of cells carrying a functional flagellum, ΔBA cells carrying an empty vector as a control, and ΔBA cells carrying psmpBssrA were grown in motility agar, and the bacteria were prepared for transmission electron microscopy analysis.

11087	Fifty-one percent of the ΔBA cells complemented with psmpBssrA had a flagellum.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11088	We transformed the ΔBA mutant with plasmids psmpBssrAH6, psmpBssrADD, or psmpBssrA (wild-type) as a control and assessed the effect of these variants on both the secretion and motility phenotypes of the ΔBA mutant.	[[19, 22], [203, 206]]	[]	['ΔBA', 'ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11089	It should be noted that the ΔBA mutants carrying the psmpBssrADD or psmpBssrA plasmids have indistinguishable growth rates..	[[28, 31]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml

[[407, 411]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11093	Since the ΔBA mutant was non-pathogenic, we investigated both proposed colonization pathways to determine if one or both were affected in the mutant cells.	[[10, 13]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11094	Our investigation revealed that although equal numbers of wild-type and mutant bacteria were phagocytosed by macrophages, the ΔBA mutant was compromised in its ability to survive and proliferate within these host cells (Figure 4).	[[126, 129]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11095	Furthermore, in an in vitro host cell cytotoxicity assay, the ΔBA mutant exhibited delayed host cell toxicity, a strong indication that they might possess a compromised TTSS (Figure 5).	[[62, 65], [169, 173]]	[]	['ΔBA', 'TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11096	Indeed, the ΔBA mutants had severely compromised capacity to secrete Yops (Figure 6).	[[12, 15]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11097	There are at least three possible explanations for the reduced intracellular levels of some effector proteins in the ΔBA strain: (1) a reduction in gene activation/transcription of yop mRNAs, (2) an increase in the rate of mRNA degradation, or (3) a decline in synthesis of some essential regulatory factors.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11098	Consistent with the first possibility, and in keeping with the immunoblot analysis of intracellular effector proteins, we found that the ΔBA mutant had substantially reduced levels of yopB, yopD, and lcrV mRNAs.	[[137, 140]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11099	Expression of the Ysc-Yop TTSS is regulated in a temperature-dependent manner by an AraC-type transcriptional activator (VirF), the transcriptional repressor (YmoA), and an intact secretion apparatus.	[[26, 30]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11100	Assembly of the TTSS and secretion of YopD relieve this repression.	[[16, 20]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11101	Given that VirF is the sole known transcriptional activator of the Ysc-Yop TTSS, the large reduction in its cellular level in smpB-ssrA cells could explain the non-pathogenic (avirulent) phenotype of this mutant..	[[75, 79]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11102	Additionally, tagging of GalE and RbsK suggests involvement of the SmpB-SsrA system in regulation of carbon source metabolism, which is consistent with our finding that the ΔBA mutant exhibits slow recovery from carbon starvation.	[[173, 176]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11103	Interestingly, in the course of our studies, we also discovered that the ΔBA mutant strain suffered severe impairment in motility, due mainly to a lack of flagella.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['ΔBA']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11104	There is evolutionary, structural, and sequence similarity between the TTSS and the bacterial motility apparatus, the flagellum [68].	[[71, 75]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11105	Previous studies have shown that mutations in fliZ significantly reduce expression of the SPI-1 TTSS components in S.	[[96, 100]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml

11107	Our results therefore support the conclusion that there is a link between regulatory mechanisms that control the flagellar and the Ysc-Yop TTSSs in Y.	[[139, 143]]	[]	['TTSS']	[]	PMC1358943.nxml
11108	In agreement with this conclusion, Petersen and Young have recently presented evidence to show that mutation in cya and crp, which encode adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP, also called CAP), have a negative affect on the expression of both the Ysc-Yop and flagellar TTSS of Y.

11141	Using genome-wide RNA interference screening, we found that this step in the viral lifecycle requires at least two host encoded pathways: the coat protein complex I (COPI) coatamer and fatty acid biosynthesis.	[[166, 170]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11142	Circumstantial evidence has implicated coat protein complex I (COPI), COPII, and autophagy.	[[63, 67]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11143	Here, Cherry and colleagues present their findings using a genome-wide RNA interference screening approach using a picorna-like virus that COPI and fatty acid biosynthesis are critical host pathways required to generate this intracellular vesicular compartment.	[[139, 143]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11144	Furthermore, they show that loss of COPI, but not COPII, is protective both in adult flies and in human cells infected with the related picornavirus, poliovirus.	[[36, 40]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11145	Depending on the specific virus, these membranes can be derived from a variety of sources within the host cell, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, or from the endolysosomal compartment [2].	[[149, 151]]	[[126, 147]]	['ER']	['endoplasmic reticulum']	PMC1599761.nxml
11146	Previous studies have implicated a number of different trafficking processes including coat protein complex I (COPI), COPII, and autophagy-mediated processes, with the membrane being derived from the ER via a COPII coatamer–mediated process or the Golgi via either COPI or autophagic vesicles [4,9–12].

11147	To accomplish this, we studied Drosophila C virus (DCV), a natural pathogen of Drosophila that readily infects the cells and animals [13].	[[51, 54]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11148	Recently, we conducted a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen and found over 100 genes required for efficient viral replication in tissue culture [20].	[[55, 59]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11149	Using this loss-of-function strategy, we found that DCV, like mammalian picornaviruses, induces a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment upon which viral RNA replication takes place.	[[52, 55]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11150	The formation of this structure was dependent on the cellular activity of COPI along with the generation of new membrane by the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.	[[74, 78]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11151	Importantly, we also found that COPI, but not COPII, was also required for poliovirus infection of human cells, demonstrating the generality of our findings..	[[32, 36]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11152	Genome-wide RNAi screening in Drosophila cells using high-throughput imaging identified 66 ribosomal proteins and 45 nonribosomal genes as required for DCV replication [20].	[[152, 155], [12, 16]]	[]	['DCV', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11153	To identify roles for the remaining genes in viral replication, we analyzed Gene Ontology (GO) associations of the 45 nonribosomal genes required for DCV replication in Drosophila cells.	[[150, 153], [91, 93]]	[]	['DCV', 'GO']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11154	In addition, Table 1 lists the 45 genes, their effects on viral replication, GO category, and whether the double-strand RNA (dsRNA) amplicons identified have potential off-target effects as predicted by 21–base pair overlaps with other annotated genes.

11155	Based on the associations with Gene Ontology (GO) categories, some biological processes were significantly overrepresented.	[[46, 48]]	[]	['GO']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11156	Specifically, statistical analysis revealed that vesicular trafficking processes were overrepresented while Drosophila-specific genes were underrepresented (30% of genome, 4% of set), suggesting that DCV selectively targets conserved features of the host cells, and not species-specific functions..

11161	One notable group of genes within the vesicle trafficking category included five of the seven COPI coatamer proteins: alphaCOP, betaCOP,beta'COP, gammaCOP, and zetaCOP (Figure 1B, p < 0.001 for enrichment relative to representation in the genome, by Fisher exact test).	[[94, 98]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11162	To confirm that loss of COPI was responsible for the phenotype and to determine whether the two COPI genes (deltaCOP and epsilonCOP [CG9543]) not identified in the screen were erroneously missed (i.e., false negatives), we synthesized additional dsRNAs for the seven COPI coatamer genes and tested them for their role in DCV replication.	[[24, 28], [96, 100], [267, 271], [321, 324], [246, 251]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11163	These analyses revealed that dsRNAs against all COPI components except epsilonCOP blocked DCV replication, although some differences in the extent of the effect were observed, possibly reflecting variability in the efficiency of the gene silencing mediated by the dsRNAs (Figure 1B).	[[48, 52], [90, 93], [29, 34], [264, 269]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV', 'dsRNA', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11164	However, neither of the dsRNAs directed against epsilonCOP had an effect on DCV replication.	[[76, 79], [24, 29]]	[]	['DCV', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11165	RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that epsilonCOP mRNA was depleted, demonstrating that the dsRNA was functional (Figure S1).	[[87, 92]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11166	However, the protein may be long-lived—something we could not assess due to the absence of antibodies directed against either this or the other Drosophila COPI proteins.	[[155, 159]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11167	This suggests that epsilonCOP may be dispensable for COPI function in both yeast and Drosophila..	[[53, 57]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11168	Two vesicular coat complexes, COPI and COPII, are required for trafficking between the ER and Golgi [22].	[[30, 34], [87, 89]]	[]	['COPI', 'ER']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11169	Whereas the COPII coatamer is required for the anterograde transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi, the COPI coatamer is required for retrograde transport of recycled proteins and membrane from the Golgi to the ER [23].

11170	Blocking either the COPI or the COPII coatamer pathways blocks protein secretion, as observed in yeast mutants for the orthologous genes and in studies using RNAi screening for genes required for general secretion [24].	[[20, 24], [158, 162]]	[]	['COPI', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11171	However, we only identified COPI-associated genes and none of the COPII coatamer components (Sec13, Sec31, Sec23, and Sec24 [CG1472]) in our screen, suggesting that either the COPII coatamer proteins are refractory to RNAi-mediated depletion in our cells or DCV replication specifically requires COPI function but not COPII..

11172	To rule out a role for COPII in DCV replication, we modified a microscopy-based assay to quantitatively monitor secretion of a plasma membrane reporter protein, Delta, to test whether the dsRNAs directed against COPII components were effective [25].	[[32, 35], [188, 193]]	[]	['DCV', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11173	Using Drosophila cells that were stably transformed with an inducible membrane-bound form of Delta (DeltaNdeMyc cells [26]), we were able to assess the effects of different dsRNAs on the secretory pathway using flow cytometry.	[[173, 178]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11175	Treatment of the cells with dsRNA against COPI (betaCOP) or COPII (sec23) components significantly decreased the extracellular levels of Delta as expected (Figure 2A).	[[42, 46], [28, 33]]	[]	['COPI', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11176	While dsRNA treatment against sec23 did not block secretion as much as knockdown of betaCOP, treatment with dsRNA against Syntaxin 5 (Syx5), a t-SNARE required at the Golgi for secretion [27], was able to block secretion to a similar extent as COPI.	[[6, 11], [108, 113]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11177	Despite this, treatment with dsRNA against sec23 or Syx5 had no effect on viral replication (unpublished data).	[[29, 34]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11178	These data suggest that DCV replication does not require a functional secretory pathway per se but instead specifically requires COPI (but not COPII) coatamer function..	[[129, 133], [24, 27]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11185	We next sought to determine which step in the viral lifecycle requires COPI function, and so we first determined whether depletion of COPI by dsRNA treatment affected DCV entry in tissue culture cells.

11186	We had previously determined that viral entry requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thus did not anticipate a requirement for COPI during entry.	[[131, 135]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11187	Nevertheless, we tested whether pretreatment with dsRNAs against control (GFP [green fluorescent protein]), COPI (betaCOP), or COPII (sec23) affected viral entry.	[[108, 112], [50, 55], [74, 77]]	[]	['COPI', 'dsRNA', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11188	To do this, the cells were pretreated with dsRNAs for 3 d and, then incubated at 4 °C to block endocytosis.	[[43, 48]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11189	Next, virions were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and allowed to bind to the surface of these dsRNA-treated cells.	[[106, 111]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11190	Using this assay, and quantitation with automated image analysis, we found that depletion of COPI (or COPII) did not block viral entry (Figure 2B)..	[[93, 97]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11191	To verify that this assay is sensitive to genes required for DCV entry, we tested the effect of Rab5, another cellular factor identified in our screen.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11193	Indeed, we found that treatment with Rab5 dsRNA resulted in a 4-fold decrease in viral entry (Figure 2B).	[[42, 47]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11194	However, our RNAi screen was able to uncover a component of the endocytic apparatus required for viral entry (Rab5) and further underscores the role for COPI as required for a step in the viral lifecycle postentry..	[[153, 157], [13, 17]]	[]	['COPI', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11195	Picornaviruses, which are similar in many respects to DCV, induce the formation of cytoplasmic vesicles of nonuniform size, and it is on the surface of these vesicles that viral RNA replication occurs [5–7].	[[54, 57]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11202	We next determined whether DCV uses these vesicles as a site for RNA replication.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11203	To this end, we generated an antibody against the DCV helicase, an integral component of the RNA replication machinery.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11204	We stained cells that were either uninfected or infected with DCV with the anti-helicase antibody and monitored localization using immunoelectron microscopy.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11205	We found that the DCV helicase was localized to the surface of these vesicles and did not stain the uninfected cells (Figure 3F–3G and unpublished data).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11206	Because DCV induces a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment and requires the COPI coatamer for replication, we tested whether this compartment might be generated by the activity of the COPI complex.	[[73, 77], [181, 185], [8, 11]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11207	If the COPI coatamer directly forms these vesicles, then this might explain why DCV replication is dependent on COPI, but not COPII, function.	[[7, 11], [112, 116], [80, 83]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11208	Thus, we tested whether depletion of COPI affected the formation of DCV-dependent vesicles by treating cells with dsRNAs against COPI (betaCOP), COPII (sec23), or a control (GFP) followed by DCV infection.

11209	At 10 h postinfection, both control cells (Figure 3B) and COPII-treated cells (sec23, Figure 3D) were densely packed with the newly formed vesicles, despite the fact that dsRNA against sec23 reduced transport of Delta to the cell surface.	[[171, 176]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11210	In contrast, the COPI-depleted cells had a 2.5-fold reduction in the percentage of cells that contained vesicles (34%, Figure 3C), suggesting that the COPI coatamer is required to generate this vesicular compartment during DCV replication..	[[17, 21], [151, 155], [223, 226]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11211	Since the COPI coatamer normally buds vesicles from the Golgi apparatus [22,29], we reasoned that the virus-induced vesicular compartment might be generated by COPI-mediated budding of vesicles from the Golgi during DCV replication.

11221	Because Golgi morphology was disrupted by DCV during replication, and depletion of the COPI coatamer blocked DCV replication; we reasoned that the Golgi morphology of COPI-depleted cells might be altered.	[[87, 91], [167, 171], [42, 45], [109, 112]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11222	Indeed, treatment of cells with dsRNA to COPI (betaCOP) led to a decrease in Golgi staining (Figure 4B), which was distinct from the change in Golgi morphology observed upon infection (compare the signal levels in uninfected cells in Figure 4A and 4B).	[[41, 45], [32, 37]]	[]	['COPI', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11223	The absolute levels of Golgi markers were decreased in COPI-treated cells, whereas the signal was dispersed in DCV-infected cells as observed by confocal microscopy.	[[55, 59], [111, 114]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11224	In contrast, treatment with dsRNA to a ribosomal protein, RpS6, which blocks DCV translation, and thus replication at a different step in the lifecycle, had no effect on Golgi morphology (unpublished data).	[[77, 80], [28, 33]]	[]	['DCV', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11225	Instead, the specific loss of COPI results in a loss of the Golgi, a defect in vesicle formation, and a block in viral replication.	[[30, 34]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11226	Together, this suggests that the vesicular compartment is formed by COPI coatamer-mediated disassembly from the Golgi during infection and that the Golgi disruption mediated by the loss of COPII does not block COPI access to the appropriate target for vesicle formation..	[[68, 72], [210, 214]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11227	The apparent requirement for the generation of a COPI-dependent vesicular compartment for DCV replication led us to hypothesize that there might be additional genes identified in our genome-wide RNAi screen that might also be required to generate this vesicular compartment.	[[49, 53], [90, 93], [195, 199]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV', 'RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11228	We screened the 45 genes and found that while the majority had no effect on the Golgi as monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy, two additional genes led to a loss in Golgi staining similar to that seen on treatment with dsRNAs against the COPI coatamer components.	[[244, 248], [225, 230]]	[]	['COPI', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11229	HLH106, also known as sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), is the master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and directly controls the transcription of CG3523 which encodes fatty acid synthase, the first rate-limiting enzymatic step in the pathway [33].	[[65, 70]]	[[22, 63]]	['SREBP']	['sterol regulatory element binding protein']	PMC1599761.nxml
11230	These results indicate that fatty acid biosynthesis is required both for DCV replication and for maintenance of the Golgi compartment.	[[73, 76]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11231	While SREBP in mammals is cholesterol responsive and as such regulates both fatty acid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, in insects SREBP responds to palmitate levels (Drosophila is a cholesterol auxotroph [35]).	[[6, 11], [139, 144]]	[]	['SREBP', 'SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11232	Nevertheless, Drosophila SREBP controls many of the same regulators of fatty acid biosynthesis, suggesting conserved functions in viral replication..	[[25, 30]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11233	To test the dependence of DCV infection on host fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo, we infected Drosophila SREBP mutants with DCV.	[[26, 29], [104, 109]]	[]	['DCV', 'SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11234	SREBP-null adults were generated by rescuing the larval lethality of the mutation with an RU486-inducible wild-type SREBP transgene that is expressed exclusively during larval development [36].	[[116, 121]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11235	Withdrawal of RU486 results in adults that do not express the rescue construct and as such are null for SREBP as measured by Western blot analysis (Figure 5A).	[[104, 109]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11236	Therefore, SREBP is dispensable in adult flies.	[[11, 16]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11237	We challenged these mutants or their heterozygous siblings with DCV and monitored viral replication using two methods.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11238	Consistent with the cell-based results, SREBP mutant flies had reduced levels of viral antigen production as compared to heterozygous matched siblings normalized to cellular tubulin levels (Figure 5B).	[[40, 45]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11239	Second, we monitored viral RNA production by RT-PCR and found that loss of SREBP severely attenuated viral replication (Figure 5C).	[[75, 80]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11240	This demonstrates that the transcriptional master regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis, SREBP, is required and limiting for viral replication in animals..	[[88, 93]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11241	(A) SREBP-null flies were generated by rescuing the larval lethality using an inducible transgene and have no detectable SREBP protein as adults as measured by immunoblot probed with anti-SREBP..	[[4, 9], [121, 126], [188, 193]]	[]	['SREBP', 'SREBP', 'SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11244	Protein lysates were generated (hours postinfection indicated [Hr p.i.], normalized, and probed with anti-DCV or anti-tubulin for normalization..	[[106, 109]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11245	(C) SREBP-null flies are resistant to viral infection as measured by viral RNA production postinfection.	[[4, 9]]	[]	['SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11246	Heterozygous or homozygous SREBP mutant flies were challenged with DCV, and viral RNA production was measured by RT-PCR at the indicated time points postinfection (Hr p.i.)..	[[67, 70], [27, 32]]	[]	['DCV', 'SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11247	We also found that there was a synthetic interaction between fatty acid biosynthesis and COPI activity in vivo.	[[89, 93]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11248	While heterozygous mutants of gammaCOP or fatty acid synthase (CG3523) were unaffected in their ability to support DCV replication, flies carrying mutant alleles for both gammaCOP and fatty acid synthase were attenuated in their ability to support DCV replication as measured by viral antigen production (Figure S2).	[[115, 118], [248, 251]]	[]	['DCV', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11249	Because attenuation of COPI, but not COPII, blocked DCV replication, we hypothesized that this effect may be generalizable to mammalian picornaviruses such as poliovirus.	[[23, 27], [52, 55]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11250	To test whether attenuation of these pathways protected human cells from poliovirus replication, we infected human cells pretreated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against control, alphaCOP or sec23B with poliovirus.	[[161, 166]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11251	We quantitated these images and observed a significant reduction of viral infection in cells transfected with siRNAs against alphaCOP as compared to control siRNA or siRNA against sec23B (Figure 6B).	[[110, 115], [157, 162], [166, 171]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11252	To confirm that the siRNA against sec23B was functional, we measured the levels of sec23B and alphaCOP by RT-PCR.	[[20, 25]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11253	We found that treatment with either sec23B or alphaCOP siRNA led to a depletion of the cognate mRNA, demonstrating that sec23B is depleted yet is dispensable for poliovirus replication in human cells (Figure 6C).	[[55, 60]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11254	Therefore, these data suggest that poliovirus replication in human cells, like DCV replication in Drosophila cells, requires COPI, while COPII activity is dispensable..	[[125, 129], [79, 82]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11255	(A) Poliovirus infection of Caco-2 cells pretransfected with siRNAs against alphaCOP results in inhibition of viral replication but not control siRNA or siRNA against sec23B as measured by immunofluorescence analysis of infected cells (nuclei [blue] = DAPI, infected cells [green] = FITC-conjugated mouse anti-enterovirus VP1)..	[[61, 66], [144, 149], [153, 158]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11256	(D) RT-PCR on Caco-2 cells treated with siRNA against alphaCOP or sec23B demonstrates that treatment with either siRNA leads to a significant depletion of the cellular mRNA and amplification of GAPDH was used as loading control..	[[40, 45], [113, 118]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11257	In this work, we have shown the dependence of DCV replication on an array of host-encoded factors.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11258	Moreover, because this RNAi methodology does not result in null alleles, but instead in hypomorphic phenotypes, we were able to identify the limiting components for viral replication in the cell.	[[23, 27]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11259	Interestingly, these host factors are significantly biased toward conserved genes as opposed to species-specific factors, demonstrating that DCV specifically, and perhaps viruses more generally, may selectively target conserved functions in the cell.	[[141, 144]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11260	Moreover, because these required, but limiting, genes are essential for DCV replication in Drosophila cells, one may presume that related viruses may be dependent on similar cellular factors for replication.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11261	Indeed, we confirmed that poliovirus replication in mammalian cells is also dependent on COPI..	[[89, 93]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11262	We found that DCV, like picornaviruses, induces the formation of a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment in infected cells and that this compartment is the site of viral RNA replication.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11263	Among the conserved genes whose disruption significantly reduced DCV replication were a group of vesicular trafficking genes including the COPI coatamer.	[[139, 143], [65, 68]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11264	Our data show that COPI was required downstream of viral entry and was essential for the production of this vesicular compartment.	[[19, 23]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11265	However, we cannot rule out the possibility that COPI is required postentry, prevesicle formation for a step in the viral lifecycle independent of its role in secretion.	[[49, 53]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11266	For autophagy, we directly tested the roles of Beclin-1, Atg5, Atg18, and Atg12 and found no defect in DCV replication (unpublished data).	[[103, 106]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11267	Because the COPI coatamer normally targets and buds from the Golgi and DCV-induced vesicles required COPI activity, we analyzed the state of the Golgi during infection.	[[12, 16], [101, 105], [71, 74]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11268	We found that normal Golgi morphology was disrupted during viral replication with many small punctae distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, consistent with the disassembly of the Golgi by the COPI coatamer and the formation of the vesicles used for RNA replication.	[[203, 207]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11269	We also demonstrated that a Golgi marker co-localizes with the RNA replication machinery at the DCV-induced vesicles.	[[96, 99]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11270	This is in part because an intact Golgi was not required for vesicle formation, suggesting that the COPI coatamer targets a specific membrane component that remains accessible even if the Golgi is apparently disrupted by the loss of cellular factors including COPII or Syx5.	[[100, 104]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11271	This raises the possibility that DCV may derive membranes from other structures that are targets for COPI-dependent vesicle formation or that DCV may in some way redirect COPI to other sites.	[[101, 105], [171, 175], [33, 36], [142, 145]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'DCV', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11272	Possible explanations for the source of COPI-mediated membrane recruitment include the ER-intermediate compartment, as COPI has also been localized to this area, or the possible anterograde transport activity of the COPI coatamer.	[[40, 44], [119, 123], [216, 220], [87, 89]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'COPI', 'ER']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11273	DCV, which is clearly dependent on COPI for the generation of its virogenic organelle and must in some way interdict normal COPI trafficking pathways, may prove to be a useful tool for dissecting COPI functions and the complex relationships between COPI, the Golgi, and the generation of vesicular structures upon which viral replication occurs..	[[35, 39], [124, 128], [196, 200], [249, 253]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI', 'COPI', 'COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11274	Under normal circumstances, in order to drive the formation of COPI vesicles, the COPI coatamer complex is bound by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1).	[[63, 67], [82, 86]]	[]	['COPI', 'COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11275	Our screen and additional experiments did not identify Drosophila Arf1, nor any of the other Arfs present in Drosophila, as being required for viral replication.	[[93, 96]]	[]	['Arf']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11276	This may be due to some functional redundancy between Arfs.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['Arf']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11277	Recent work on poliovirus demonstrated that a number of different Arfs were recruited to the poliovirus replication complexes [12].	[[66, 69]]	[]	['Arf']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11278	Moreover, in a screen for factors involved in general secretion in Drosophila cells, two Arfs were essential [38].	[[89, 92]]	[]	['Arf']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11279	Together, this may point to functional redundancy of Arfs under certain conditions in a variety of systems..	[[53, 56]]	[]	['Arf']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11280	Once we identified the COPI complex as necessary for vesicle formation and Golgi maintenance, we reexamined the additional factors identified during the initial screen and found that suppression of fatty acid metabolism (SREBP and CG3523) decreased viral replication in vitro and in vivo and also prevented the formation of the vesicular compartment.	[[23, 27], [221, 226]]	[]	['COPI', 'SREBP']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11281	This is perhaps not surprising since morphometric analysis of membrane profiles in DCV-infected cells indicated that there was a 2-fold increase in membrane surface area within 10 h of infection.	[[83, 86]]	[]	['DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11282	Thus, virus infection leads to membrane redistribution involving both the Golgi and COPI as well as membrane expansion through de novo lipid biogenesis.	[[84, 88]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11283	Because the size of the virally induced vesicles (mean = 115 nm) was significantly larger than that of normal COPI vesicles (mean = 50 nm), they may be formed in part by active membrane biosynthesis at the budding site.	[[110, 114]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11284	Nevertheless, this coupling of fatty acid biosynthesis with COPI coatamer budding from the Golgi results in Golgi disassembly and the formation of a novel cytoplasmic vesicular compartment upon which viral RNA replication takes place..	[[60, 64]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11285	Moreover, how viruses such as DCV coordinate and activate these cellular processes has yet to be shown, making this Drosophila-DCV system an ideal model both to identify cellular factors required for viral replication and to study how virus-dependent cellular structures and organelles are generated de novo from preexisting components within a cell..	[[30, 33], [127, 130]]	[]	['DCV', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11286	Importantly, the work presented herein confirms the relevance of the cell culture model used to perform the initial RNAi screen by demonstrating a requirement in vivo for the machinery which produces the virogenic organelle.	[[116, 120]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11287	Moreover, we found that both COPI and fatty acid biosynthetic machinery were essential for viral replication in adult animals.	[[29, 33]]	[]	['COPI']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml
11288	Using a similar loss-of-function strategy in human cells, we found that, like DCV infection of Drosophila cells, poliovirus infection of human cells required COPI while COPII appeared dispensable.	[[158, 162], [78, 81]]	[]	['COPI', 'DCV']	[]	PMC1599761.nxml

11302	Many bacterial pathogens employ a type III secretion system to deliver type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) into host cells, where they interact directly with host substrates to modulate defense pathways and promote disease.	[[100, 104]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11304	We propose that these secreted virulence genes have evolved through a shuffling process we have called “terminal reassortment.” In terminal reassortment, existing T3SE termini are mobilized within the genome, creating random genetic fusions that result in chimeric genes.

11305	Up to 32% of T3SE families in species with relatively large and well-characterized T3SE repertoires show evidence of terminal reassortment, as compared to only 7% of non-T3SE families.	[[13, 17], [83, 87], [170, 174]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11307	Because this process plays a more significant role in the evolution of T3SEs than non-effectors, it provides insight into the evolutionary origins of T3SEs and may also help explain the rapid emergence of new infectious agents..	[[71, 75], [150, 154]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11308	These proteins, known as type III secreted effectors (T3SEs), are directly injected into the host's cells and facilitate the disease process by interacting with host proteins and interfering with the defense response.	[[54, 58]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11312	Chimeric T3SEs are present in eight different genera and in some cases are present in as many as 32% of known T3SE families.	[[9, 13], [110, 114]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11313	Terminal reassortment may lead to the very rapid evolution of new T3SEs, thereby contributing to the emergence of new infectious diseases..	[[66, 70]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11314	The type III secretion system (T3SS) and the proteins that traverse it are essential components of the virulence arsenal of many destructive bacterial pathogens.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['T3SS']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11315	Pathogens utilize the T3SS to inject type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) into the host cell cytosol where they function to promote disease by facilitating cell attachment and entry, suppressing the host defense response, and modulating vesicular traffic, the host cytoskeleton, and hormones [1–3].	[[66, 70], [22, 26]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SS']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11316	Consequently, T3SEs play a prominent role in bacterial pathogenesis and host-association [4] ..	[[14, 18]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11317	This modularity has been exploited in genetic screens designed to identify new T3SEs [7–9] and for creating reporters to monitor T3SS-dependent secretion [6,10].	[[79, 83], [129, 133]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SS']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11318	Another feature common to the vast majority of T3SEs is that they are co-regulated with the assembly of the T3SS.	[[47, 51]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11319	This is achieved through T3SS-specific transcription factors that bind regulatory motifs found immediately upstream of nearly every T3SE and T3SS structural gene [11].	[[132, 136], [25, 29], [141, 145]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SS', 'T3SS']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11320	An important functional consequence of the respective locations of these two T3SE features is that the regulatory motifs required for transcriptional activation of T3SEs are tightly linked to the signals required for secretion and translocation..	[[77, 81], [164, 168]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11321	Despite several commonalities, T3SEs are evolutionarily diverse and highly variable in their distribution, both within and among species [9].	[[31, 35]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11322	Given their high degree of genetic diversity, it is perhaps not surprising that a number of studies have identified T3SEs that are truncated or chimeras of other sequences [10,19–22]; nevertheless, no study has recognized this particular form of variation as being significant from the perspective of either evolution or function.	[[116, 120]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11323	Here, we report on an evolutionary process that plays an extremely important role in the evolution of new T3SEs.	[[106, 110]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11324	Unlike previous studies that have reported the introduction of genetic variation through homologous intragenic recombination [23–28], the evolution of T3SEs is strongly influenced by a non-homologous recombinational process that is analogous to exon shuffling seen in eukaryotes.	[[151, 155]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11325	This process not only explains the high frequency of truncated and chimeric T3SEs, but also provides insight into how the particular structure of these genes contributes to dramatic evolutionary and functional changes that may play a key role in the ongoing arms race between pathogen and host..	[[76, 80]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11326	The complete nucleotide and protein sequences of all experimentally confirmed T3SEs were collected from the 23 species having at least one characterized T3SE (Table S1).	[[78, 82], [153, 157]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11327	Using a combination of BLASTP, TBLASTX, and pair-wise BLAST (BL2SEQ), we identified two common and interrelated features among T3SEs from all species.	[[127, 131]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11328	First, the N or C terminus of many T3SEs are homologous (E value <10−5) to other loci or open reading frames.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11329	We will refer to these homologs as orphan effector termini (ORPHETs).	[[60, 66]]	[]	['ORPHET']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11330	Second, many T3SEs are chimeras of either two known T3SEs, or a T3SE and another gene..	[[13, 17], [52, 56], [64, 68]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11331	ORPHETs and chimeric T3SEs were found in nine species, representing plant pathogens, animal pathogens, and mutualists.	[[21, 25]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11332	The largest number of chimeric T3SEs and ORPHETs were identified in the species with the largest T3SE repertoires, which included Pseudomonas syringae (12 of 56 T3SE families, 21%), Salmonella enterica (5/28, 18%), and Xanthomonas campestris (7/22, 32%) (Table 1).	[[41, 47], [31, 35], [97, 101], [161, 165]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11333	The high frequency of ORPHETs and chimeric effectors has led us to propose that the evolution of new T3SEs frequently occurs by the reassortment of termini from preexisting T3SEs.	[[22, 28], [101, 105], [173, 177]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11334	This stochastic process, which we will refer to as “terminal reassortment,” involves the fusion of an existing T3SE N terminus to another T3SE, or an unrelated coding or non-coding sequence (Figure 1).	[[111, 115], [138, 142]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11335	Alternatively, terminal reassortment may occur via a large deletion that brings the N terminus of a T3SE into contact with a region downstream of the effector (Figure 1).	[[100, 104]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11336	Terminal reassortment does not describe or rely on a specific recombinational mechanism, but rather describes an evolutionary process that results in the rapid formation of new T3SEs via a single quantum evolutionary step in which the regulatory and secretion/translocation signals are coupled to new sequences..	[[177, 181]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11337	syringae, which has approximately 190 T3SE homologs and derivatives distributed among 56 T3SE families [10], provides the most interesting examples of ORPHETs and ORPHET-derived T3SEs.

11338	For example, one group of related T3SEs in P.	[[34, 38]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11339	syringae contains two ORPHETs, HopW1–2PmaES4326 and HopW1–2Pph1448A, and two larger T3SEs, HopW1–1PmaES4326 and HopAE1PsyB728a, all of which are homologous along their first 85 amino acids (Figure 2A).	[[22, 28], [84, 88]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11340	The two ORPHETs are clearly related to the N terminus of the larger T3SEs, while the two larger T3SEs are chimeras themselves, with HopW1–1PmaES4326 sharing C-terminal homology to a prophage-related sequence from Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933, and HopAE1PsyB728a [29] sharing C-terminal homology to several putative Xanthomonas virulence genes.

11341	Indeed, hopW1–1PmaES4326 is situated near its ORPHET on plasmid pPMA4326B and is flanked by numerous IS elements [30].	[[46, 52]]	[]	['ORPHET']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11342	All of these related T3SEs except hopW1–1PmaES4326 also have a highly conserved ribosome-binding site and hrp box.	[[21, 25]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11344	This exchange of promoters is functionally significant since changes to the hrp box sequence and its relative distance from the start codon has been shown to alter T3SE expression and bacterial virulence [31]..	[[164, 168]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11345	An analysis of the flanking regions of ORPHETs indicates that they are not merely misannotations due to frameshift mutations in “full-length” T3SEs, nor are they incomplete sequence submissions.	[[39, 45], [142, 146]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11346	ORPHETs are homologous to their respective T3SEs and exhibit both conservation in either their 5′ or 3′ flanking regions (Table S2), and variation at the end of their protein-coding region, which is consistent with random mobilization and insertion, or large-scale deletion downstream of the T3SE secretion signal.	[[43, 47], [292, 296]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11347	Furthermore, because a single ORPHET can constitute the N terminus of multiple effectors, as with the HopW1/HopAE1 (Figure 2A) and HopAB3 effector families (Table 1), ORPHETs likely serve as precursors for the formation of new T3SEs..

11352	In these screens, an effector C terminus (reporter) is linked to a transposon, which integrates randomly in the bacterial genome, occasionally creating a functional fusion with an appropriate T3SS regulatory and secretion signal.	[[192, 196]]	[]	['T3SS']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11353	Using these and related techniques, secretion and translocation into the host has been experimentally demonstrated for many ORPHETs, including HopAT1 [42] and HopS1 [43] from P.	[[124, 130]]	[]	['ORPHET']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11354	Indeed, over 50% of ORPHETs or chimeric T3SEs are associated with mobile elements (Table 1).	[[20, 26], [40, 44]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11355	Phage may serve as mixing vessels for T3SEs, or provide the novel genetic variation and homologous sequence for recombination.	[[38, 42]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11356	Both phage and plasmids, as well as transposable elements, ultimately provide multiple copies of ORPHETs or T3SE precursors.	[[97, 103], [108, 112]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11357	Consequently, terminal reassortment can occur without loss of the original effector or ORPHET..	[[87, 93]]	[]	['ORPHET']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11358	An analysis of the relationship between the number of ORPHETs and chimeras, and the number of T3SE homology families identified for each species (Figure 4A) reveals a very strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.91, p < 0.0001, Figure 4B), reinforcing the significance of terminal reassortment on the evolution of T3SEs.

11359	Approximately one out of every 4.2 T3SE families (weighted mean = 24% of T3SE families) carries an ORPHET or chimeric T3SE.	[[99, 105], [35, 39], [73, 77]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11360	This is significant because it indicates that terminal reassortment is strongly influencing the evolution of T3SEs.	[[109, 113]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11361	Additional support for the importance of terminal reassortment in the evolution of T3SE is apparent when the frequency of ORPHETs and chimeras in T3SE homology families is compared to the frequency of truncated and chimeric loci among families of non-T3SE proteins.

11367	Given this, it is possible that terminal reassortment simply occurs more frequently in the flexible genome, and therefore, our observations are a consequence of the genomic context of T3SEs, rather than something inherent to T3SEs themselves.	[[184, 188], [225, 229]]	[]	['T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11368	In comparison, only 9.3% of the 204 non-T3SE truncated and chimeric loci were absent from one or two of the three sequenced P.	[[40, 44]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11369	One would expect a larger fraction of the non-T3SE truncated and chimeric loci to be in the flexible genome if terminal reassortment were simply a byproduct of those processes acting on the flexible genome.	[[46, 50]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11370	Furthermore, 69.7% of the 204 non-T3SE truncated or chimeric loci have homologs in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, further supporting the contention that these loci are not components of the flexible genome.	[[34, 38]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11372	We believe that the high frequency of ORPHETs and chimeras among T3SE is due to three key features that are collectively unique to T3SEs.	[[38, 44], [65, 69], [131, 135]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11373	First and foremost, T3SEs are modular [5,6], with all of the signals required for expression, secretion, and translocation located in close proximity.	[[20, 24]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11374	Second, T3SEs are under intense selective pressures due to their central roles in pathogenesis and host adaptation [16].	[[8, 12]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11375	Third, T3SEs are commonly associated with mobile elements [40,41], which can act as catalysts for the reassortment of linked loci..	[[7, 11]]	[]	['T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11376	Horizontal gene transfer may be responsible for the supply of precursor ORPHETs and T3SEs and the introduction of novel genetic variation that will eventually serve as the target.	[[72, 78], [84, 88]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml
11377	The association of ORPHETs and T3SEs with multi-copy mobile elements provides a substantial pool of these elements, and as a result, terminal reassortment does not necessarily lead to loss of the original T3SE or ORPHET precursor..	[[19, 25], [213, 219], [31, 35], [205, 209]]	[]	['ORPHET', 'ORPHET', 'T3SE', 'T3SE']	[]	PMC1599762.nxml

11382	Because ORPHETs are often mobilized with their upstream regulatory and binding motifs, virtually any coding or non-coding gene segment can be instantly recruited by an N-terminal secretion domain to serve as part of a new T3SE with potentially new virulence function, effectively making a novel virulence protein in a single quantum step.

11512	Plasmodium vivax invades reticulocytes exclusively, and this observation has led to the identification of the reticulocyte binding-like family (RBL) of adhesins [15], which are also conserved in Plasmodium falciparum, despite the fact that this species invades erythrocytes [16].

11517	An analysis of Toxoplasma rhomboid enzymes indicates that one of its six rhomboid proteases, TgROM5, is localized to the posterior surface of the tachyzoite and cleaves several different adhesins essential for host-cell invasion, including TgMIC2, the TRAP homolog [28].	[[252, 256]]	[]	['TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11518	We therefore sought to study the enzymatic properties of Plasmodium falciparum rhomboid proteins (PfROMs) directly and test their ability to process transmembrane adhesins implicated in invasion, as a first step in assessing the potential involvement of PfROMs in host-cell invasion.	[[98, 103], [254, 259]]	[]	['PfROM', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11519	We discovered that the specificity of TgROM5 appears to be covered by two distinct PfROMs; PfROM1 and PfROM4 display strong substrate specificity and preferentially cleave different adhesin families.	[[83, 88]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11520	Together, these two PfROMs are able to cleave all four families of transmembrane adhesins implicated in invasion.	[[20, 25]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11521	Since rhomboid enzymes are highly specific proteases and are expressed during invasion, these observations suggest that two distinct PfROM proteases are likely to process many diverse adhesins during all invasive stages of the Plasmodium lifecycle..	[[133, 138]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11522	Three families of adhesins have been implicated directly in this process: AMA1, the EBL adhesins EBA-175, BAEBL/EBA-140, and JESEBL/EBA-181 and the RBL adhesins Rh1, Rh2a, Rh2b, and Rh4.	[[74, 78], [84, 87], [148, 151]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL', 'RBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11523	Analysis of transmembrane sequences from these adhesins revealed that AMA1 contains residues that have been found to allow cleavage by rhomboid proteases (i.e., alanines, serines, and isoleucines).	[[70, 74]]	[]	['AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11524	Conversely, while EBL and RBL adhesins also have small helix-relaxing residues such as alanines, glycines, and serines within the top half of their transmembrane domains, these residues are preceded by large aromatic residues (Figure 1B), which are not efficient substrates for rhomboid enzymes studied thus far [33].	[[18, 21], [26, 29]]	[]	['EBL', 'RBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml

11528	Since the EBL and RBL adhesins contain very large ectodomains of approximately 140 to 300 kDa, we generated truncated forms of EBLs that started from region VI and proceeded to their natural C-terminal cytoplasmic ends, preceded by a GFP tag.

11529	The huge extracellular regions of RBL proteins contain no identifiable domains [23,37]; we therefore cloned the C-terminal–most regions starting at various points before their transmembrane anchors, beginning at regions that appear to confer disordered structures composed of tandem asparagine repeats and extending to their natural C-terminal ends.

11530	GFP-tagged adhesins were transiently co-transfected with DmRho-1 into COS cells, and cleavage was monitored by accumulation of the cleaved and secreted ectodomains in cell culture media by Western analysis.	[[57, 64]]	[]	['DmRho-1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml

11532	This analysis revealed that while AMA1 was an efficient substrate for DmRho-1, none of the remaining seven EBL or RBL adhesins could be cleaved by DmRho-1 to any detectable degree (Figure 1C), raising the possibility that the majority of adhesins may not be processed by rhomboid proteases in Plasmodium..

11533	Since nothing is known about the function of PfROMs, it was important to study their enzymatic properties directly and to assess their ability to process any Plasmodium adhesins directly.	[[45, 50]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11534	The remaining four PfROMs that do not have homologs in Toxoplasma are sequentially numbered PfROM7 through PfROM10..	[[19, 24]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11535	Based on a sequence analysis, several PfROMs are unlikely to cleave adhesins during host-cell invasion.	[[38, 43]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11536	Four PfROMs are expressed in the merozoite stage of the lifecycle, while PfROM3 (MAL8P1.16) is highly expressed in gametocytes and PfROM9 (PFE0755c) is expressed very weakly.	[[5, 10]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11537	We thus chose to focus our analysis on PfROMs 1, 4, 7, and 8.	[[39, 44]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11538	Notably, PfROMs 1 and 4 are conserved in other Apicomplexa including in Toxoplasma, while PfROMs 7 (PF13_0312) and 8 (PF14_0110) have atypical topologies and are not conserved among Apicomplexa..	[[9, 14], [90, 95]]	[]	['PfROM', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11539	In order to test the ability of PfROMs to cleave adhesins, we sought to adapt the transfection-based proteolysis assay.	[[32, 37]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11540	We first used this assay to test for proteolytic activity of PfROMs (Figure 2).	[[61, 66]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11541	Mammalian cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged Spitz and PfROMs, and cleavage of Spitz was assessed by Western analysis of cell culture media for the cleaved form of GFP-Spitz, which is secreted by the cells..

11542	While Toxoplasma ROM1 and ROM5 have robust activity against Spitz, only PfROM1 of the four PfROMs proved to be active against Spitz (Figure 2B).	[[91, 96]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11543	Since we discovered one PfROM to be active, we next tested the ability of PfROMs to process GFP-tagged Plasmodium adhesins directly.	[[92, 95], [24, 29], [74, 79]]	[]	['GFP', 'PfROM', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11544	AMA1 is an efficient substrate for DmRho-1 (Figure 1C), and its co-transfection with TgROM5 and PfROM1, but not TgROM1 or PfROMs 4, 7, and 8, resulted in AMA1 cleavage (Figure 3A).	[[154, 158], [35, 42], [122, 127]]	[]	['AMA1', 'DmRho-1', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11545	Finally, mutation of residues in the AMA1 transmembrane domain in the full-length adhesin strongly reduced cleavage by TgROM5 and by PfROM1, suggesting that PfROM-1 recognizes AMA1 by this region (Figure 3B).	[[37, 41], [176, 180], [157, 162]]	[]	['AMA1', 'AMA1', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11546	This mutant AMA1 was still shed efficiently by cellular metalloproteases, arguing that the mutant form of the protein was expressed and trafficked correctly.	[[12, 16]]	[]	['AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11547	Therefore, PfROM-1 uses a similar specificity mechanism to cleave AMA1..	[[66, 70], [11, 16]]	[]	['AMA1', 'PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11548	Despite not being substrates for the model rhomboid protease DmRho-1, we also examined the ability of parasite rhomboid enzymes to cleave GFP-tagged EBL adhesins directly.	[[61, 68], [149, 152], [138, 141]]	[]	['DmRho-1', 'EBL', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11549	Surprisingly, both TgROM5 and PfROM4 were able to cleave each EBL adhesin robustly, while PfROM1 was able to cleave them weakly (Figure 4A to 4C).	[[62, 65]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11550	Note that PfROM4, which failed to show any activity against Spitz or AMA1, displayed very strong activity against all EBLs tested and is the first rhomboid enzyme found to be active but cannot process Spitz.	[[69, 73], [118, 121]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11551	Moreover, mutating the predicted active site serine of PfROM4 to alanine abolished cleavage of EBA-175 and BAEBL (Figure 4D).	[[109, 112]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11552	Therefore, despite having large hydrophobic residues within the top of their transmembrane domains and not being substrates for the canonical DmRho-1, EBL adhesins were strong substrates for certain parasite rhomboid enzymes..	[[142, 149], [151, 154]]	[]	['DmRho-1', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11553	Since DmRho-1 was not able to cleave any EBL adhesin, the ability of parasite ROMs to cleave EBL adhesins suggested a different mechanism of specificity.	[[6, 13], [41, 44], [93, 96]]	[]	['DmRho-1', 'EBL', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11554	To address whether the same region of the EBL adhesins was being recognized by parasite rhomboid proteins, we mutated the top half of both BAEBL and EBA-175 transmembrane domains to that of TGFα.	[[42, 45], [141, 144]]	[]	['EBL', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11555	Since parasite rhomboid enzymes were able to cleave EBL adhesins that contain sequences within their transmembrane domains that are not conducive for Drosophila rhomboid cleavage [33], we also examined the ability of parasite rhomboid proteins to cleave Rh adhesins..	[[52, 55]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11556	Co-transfection of GFP-tagged Rh adhesins with TgROM5 and PfROM4 resulted in cleavage of all Rh proteins, with Rh1, Rh2a, and Rh4 being cleaved better than Rh2b (Figure 5A to 5D).	[[19, 22]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11557	PfROM1 was also able to cleave Rh1, Rh2b, and Rh4, while PfROMs 7 and 8 were unable to cleave any Rh protein.	[[57, 62]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11558	One surprising outcome of these analyses is that PfROM1, like TgROM5, is similar to the Spitz-cleaving class of rhomboid proteases, while PfROM4 is unable to cleave Spitz but is able to cleave EBL adhesins.	[[193, 196]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11559	To determine which regions of the different adhesins confer specificity for cleavage by PfROM1 compared to PfROM4, we generated chimeric molecules between AMA1 and BAEBL in which their transmembrane regions were interchanged.	[[155, 159], [166, 169]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11560	TgROM5, which can cleave both AMA1 and BAEBL, cleaved both chimeras well, indicating that the chimeric proteins are correctly folded and trafficked in cells (Figure 6A).	[[30, 34], [41, 44]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11561	PfROM1 can cleave BAEBL weakly, but substituting the AMA1 transmembrane domain converted this form of BAEBL into an efficient substrate for PfROM1.	[[53, 57], [20, 23], [104, 107]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11562	Conversely, while PfROM4 can cleave BAEBL very efficiently but cannot cleave AMA1, it was no longer able to cleave BAEBL harboring the transmembrane domain from AMA1..	[[77, 81], [161, 165], [38, 41], [117, 120]]	[]	['AMA1', 'AMA1', 'EBL', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml

11564	Conversely, while PfROM1 could cleave AMA1 (and BAEBL only weakly), substituting the transmembrane domain from BAEBL into AMA1 reduced the ability of PfROM1 to cleave this AMA1 chimera.

11565	Again, TgROM5, which cleaves both AMA1 and BAEBL efficiently, cleaved BAEBL and BAEBL with the AMA1 transmembrane domain..	[[34, 38], [95, 99], [45, 48], [72, 75], [82, 85]]	[]	['AMA1', 'AMA1', 'EBL', 'EBL', 'EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11566	All of these rhomboid enzymes could not cleave BAEBL efficiently or at all, while replacing the BAEBL transmembrane domain with that from AMA1 converted BAEBL into an efficient substrate for these rhomboid proteases (Figure 6C)..

11568	In addition to the AMA1, EBL, and RBL adhesins that are involved in merozoite invasion of red blood cells, the TRAP family of adhesins are also thought to be essential for invasion, because only their cytoplasmic tails are known to bind the parasite cytoskeleton through the bridging protein aldolase, thus linking the moving junction to the motor complex essential for invasion [22].

11575	Co-transfection of full-length MTRAP and PTRAMP adhesins and a truncated PFF0800c as GFP fusions with TgROM5 resulted in processing of MTRAP and PFF0800w, but not PTRAMP (Figure 7).	[[85, 88], [32, 36], [136, 140]]	[]	['GFP', 'TRAP', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11576	Like TRAP, PFF0800w and MTRAP could be cleaved by PfROM4, although the cleavage was weak, perhaps because these adhesins contain residues not generally conducive for rhomboid cleavage (Figure 1B).	[[5, 9], [25, 29]]	[]	['TRAP', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11577	Thus, while TRAP, MTRAP, and PFF0800w are substrates for both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium rhomboid proteases, PTRAMP could not be cleaved by any rhomboid protease tested..	[[12, 16], [19, 23]]	[]	['TRAP', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11578	Genetic evidence has implicated CTRP, a large circumsporozoite and TRAP-related protein expressed in ookinetes, as essential for penetration of the midgut epithelium [44–46].	[[67, 71]]	[]	['TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11579	In addition to TRAP, MAEBL, a chimeric protein with the adhesive domains M1 and M2 homologous to AMA1 and its C-terminal region to EBLs, was found to be essential for invasion of salivary glands by sporozoites [47].	[[97, 101], [23, 26], [131, 134], [15, 19]]	[]	['AMA1', 'EBL', 'EBL', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11580	Both contain transmembrane sequences that would not be expected to be efficient rhomboid substrates (Figure 1B), and neither could be cleaved by DmRho-1 (unpublished data) but may be substrates for the newly discovered specificity of PfROM4..	[[145, 152]]	[]	['DmRho-1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11581	Since CTRP is a large protein with an approximately 3,000 amino acid extracellular domain, we tagged a truncated version of CTRP with GFP as for other large adhesins, starting with its first of six thrombospondin domains and proceeding to its natural end.	[[134, 137]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11582	A truncated form of MAEBL, starting from region VI and proceeding to its natural end like for the EBLs, was tagged with GFP at its N terminus.	[[22, 25], [98, 101], [120, 123]]	[]	['EBL', 'EBL', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11583	Co-transfection of CTRP and MAEBL with TgROM5 and PfROM4 resulted in strong cleavage of both proteins, while co-transfection with PfROM1 resulted in less cleavage (Figure 8).	[[30, 33]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11584	These observations indicate that both CTRP and MAEBL are substrates for PfROM-catalyzed intramembrane proteolysis, and since both PfROMs 1 and 4 are expressed in these invasive stages, raise the possibility that PfROMs could also function during host-cell invasion in the mosquito vector..

11585	Surprisingly, the main adhesin-cleaving rhomboid from Toxoplasma, TgROM5, is not conserved in Plasmodium [28,29], but our analysis now indicates that two separate PfROMs take its place.	[[163, 168]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11586	The Spitz-cleaving rhomboid protease encoded by Plasmodium is PfROM1, which relies on the same substrate motif in the transmembrane domain to cleave Spitz and AMA1 as most other canonical rhomboid proteases [28,33].	[[159, 163]]	[]	['AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11587	Conversely, PfROM4 contains a novel specificity that is the predominant activity for cleaving EBL, RBL, and TRAP adhesins.	[[94, 97], [99, 102], [108, 112]]	[]	['EBL', 'RBL', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11588	One implication of these findings is the potential redundancy of PfROMs 1 and 4 in EBL/RBL adhesin processing, and this should be noted when designing genetic experiments aimed at deciphering the role of these enzymes in parasite invasion..	[[65, 70], [87, 90]]	[]	['PfROM', 'RBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11589	However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other PfROMs can cleave adhesins in parasites but rely on other unidentified cofactors or conditions not recapitulated in our transfection-based assay.	[[54, 59]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11590	AMA1, EBL, RBL, and MTRAP adhesins are thought to play essential roles during erythrocyte invasion by merozoites, and most are experimentally known to be cleaved during invasion [14,23,24,37].	[[6, 9], [11, 14], [21, 25]]	[]	['EBL', 'RBL', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11591	However, processing of most of these adhesins has not been studied directly, although AMA1 has been shown to be a substrate for both intramembrane and juxtamembrane proteolysis in merozoites under physiological conditions [27].	[[86, 90]]	[]	['AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11592	PfROM4 is likely to be the major activity for EBL, RBL, and MTRAP cleavage; while contrary to previous proposals, our current analysis indicates that the intramembrane proteolytic activity for AMA1 is likely provided by PfROM1, not PfROM4, because PfROM1 is unique among PfROMs expressed in merozoites in being able to cleave AMA1 directly.

11593	Invasion of hepatocytes, which establishes the infection following a bite of the female mosquito, is currently known to rely only on two adhesins: TRAP and AMA1 [49,50].	[[156, 160], [147, 151]]	[]	['AMA1', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11594	We have determined that TRAP is a potent substrate for PfROM4, suggesting that PfROM4 might be the TRAP sheddase during invasion of hepatocytes.	[[24, 28], [99, 103]]	[]	['TRAP', 'TRAP']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11595	Importantly, AMA1 has recently been found to be expressed in sporozoites, where its proteolytic cleavage was insensitive to PMSF [50], a compound that potently inhibited AMA1 cleavage by PfSUB2 in merozoites [27,51].	[[13, 17], [170, 174]]	[]	['AMA1', 'AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11596	This observation raises the possibility that other proteases may be involved in AMA1 processing in sporozoites.	[[80, 84]]	[]	['AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11597	Since AMA1 can be cleaved by PfROM1, which is expressed in sporozoites, we suggest that PfROM1 may process AMA1 during sporozoite invasion of host cells..	[[6, 10], [107, 111]]	[]	['AMA1', 'AMA1']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11598	Although much less is known about host-cell invasion and the adhesins involved in the mosquito host, both PfROMs 1 and 4 are expressed in both gametocytes and sporozoites.	[[106, 111]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11599	Nevertheless, our data show that PfROM4 and, to a weaker extent, PfROM1 are able to cleave both the CTRP and MAEBL adhesins, the only two adhesins that are known to be essential for mosquito midgut [44–46] and salivary gland invasion [47], respectively.	[[111, 114]]	[]	['EBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11600	Various adhesins are thought to form the moving junction directly; EBL/RBL adhesins engage the host-cell receptor for invasion [14,17,18,23,24,37], while TRAP adhesins such as MTRAP in merozoites are thought to link the moving junction to the parasite cytoskeleton (since EBLs/RBLs are not thought to be able to bind cytoskeletal components directly) [21,22].

11601	Importantly, our current work suggests that both the EBL and RBL adhesins, and other adhesins, go through the same proteolytic processing pathway, mediated by PfROMs 1 and 4.	[[53, 56], [159, 164], [61, 64]]	[]	['EBL', 'PfROM', 'RBL']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11602	Moreover, cleavage of adhesins implicated in invasion by sporozoites and ookinetes by PfROMs suggests that rhomboid enzymes could also be targets in other parts of the parasite lifecycle.	[[86, 91]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml
11603	With this in mind, PfROMs warrant further cell biological and genetic study to complement our biochemical analysis, which together should reveal the full biological roles of these membrane enzymes..	[[19, 24]]	[]	['PfROM']	[]	PMC1599764.nxml

11652	Despite strong amino acid sequence homology between ANTXR1 and ANTXR2, there are striking differences in the PA binding activities of the two receptors.	[[52, 69], [109, 111]]	[]	['ANTXR1 and ANTXR2', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11653	When the PA heptamer is bound to ANTXR2, a pH value of approximately 5.0 is required to allow efficient pore formation, whereas approximately pH 6 is required for PA pore formation when the toxin is bound to ANTXR1 [20,37].	[[9, 11], [163, 165]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11654	Also, the metal-dependent PA binding affinity of the ANTXR1 I domain is weaker than that of ANTXR2 by approximately 1,000-fold (KD = 130 nM or 1.1 μM in Mg2+ or Ca2+, respectively) [38].	[[26, 28]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11655	Indeed, the ANTXR1 I domain–PA binding affinity in the presence of metal ions is similar to the ANTXR2 I domain–PA binding affinity in the absence of metal ions (KD = 960 nM in EDTA/EGTA) [35]..	[[28, 30], [112, 114]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11656	Because PA-ANTXR2 binding appeared to be less dependent on interactions mediated by the metal ion, we reasoned that the PA–ANTXR2 interaction should be less sensitive to mutations of PA residue D683.	[[8, 10], [183, 185]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11657	Here we show that this is the case and that PA proteins with D683 mutations bind specifically to human and rodent ANTXR2 and mediate intoxication via these receptors.	[[44, 46]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11658	We also show that a single region of nonconserved receptor residues that bind PA domain 2 is responsible for the differential abilities of ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 to bind D683 mutant forms of PA.	[[139, 156], [78, 80]]	[]	['ANTXR1 and ANTXR2', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11659	Moreover, we demonstrate that a D683K mutant form of PA mediates lethal toxin killing of rats, implicating ANTXR2 as a physiologically important anthrax toxin receptor..	[[53, 55]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11660	Previously, PA residue D683, which contacts the receptor-bound metal ion (Figure 1), was shown to be critically important for the interaction of PA with ANTXR1: mutation of this residue to Asn completely abrogated receptor binding [34].	[[12, 14], [145, 147]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11661	To test the dependence of ANTXR2-PA binding on PA D683, this residue was replaced with either an asparagine or a lysine.	[[33, 35], [47, 49]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11662	The resultant PAD683N and PAD683K proteins were tested for their abilities to bind to a soluble human ANTXR2 protein (sANTXR2) and a full-length human ANTXR2–enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein expressed on PA receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-R1.1 cells.	[[273, 276], [194, 198], [228, 230], [118, 125]]	[[158, 192]]	['CHO', 'EGFP', 'PA', 'sANTXR2']	['enhanced green fluorescent protein']	PMC1617126.nxml
11663	Additionally, cells expressing ANTXR2-EGFP were tested for their ability to be intoxicated with PAD683N or PAD683K and LFN-DTA, a recombinant protein composed of the N-terminal PA-binding portion of LF fused to the catalytic A chain of diphtheria toxin, which kills CHO cells.	[[266, 269], [38, 42], [199, 201], [177, 179]]	[]	['CHO', 'EGFP', 'LF', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11664	For control purposes, these experiments were also performed with CHO-R1.1 cells engineered to express a human ANTXR1-EGFP fusion protein..	[[65, 68], [117, 121]]	[]	['CHO', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11665	Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, performed as described previously [35], revealed that PAD683N binds tightly to the sANTXR2 I domain, KD = 28 (±1.7) and 17 (±0.68) nM in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively.	[[125, 132], [27, 30]]	[]	['sANTXR2', 'SPR']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11666	Flow cytometric analysis performed with one of the altered proteins, PAD683K, confirmed that it bound to cells expressing ANTXR2-EGFP but not ANTXR1-EGFP (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C).	[[129, 133], [149, 153]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11667	Consistently, both PAD683N and PAD683K supported the intoxication of cells expressing human ANTXR2-EGFP (Figure 2D) but not ANTXR1-EGFP (Figure 2E).	[[99, 103], [131, 135]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11668	Indeed, cells expressing ANTXR2-EGFP were just as susceptible to PAD683K-dependent killing as they were to wild-type PA-dependent killing (Figure 2D).	[[32, 36], [117, 119]]	[]	['EGFP', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11669	We conclude that PA residue D683 is not critical for toxin action mediated by ANTXR2 in the range of toxin concentrations tested..	[[17, 19]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11670	Based on the co-crystal structures of ANTXR2 bound to PA (Figure 1), there are eight contact residues that would be different at the toxin-binding interface in ANTXR1: A56L, N57H, Q88R, S113L, V115G, D152H, G153E, and L154D [31,32] (Figure S1).	[[54, 56]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11671	We reasoned that the differential abilities of the receptors to bind mutant PA proteins would be due to one or more of these variable amino acids.	[[76, 78]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11672	To test this idea, each of these amino acid substitutions was introduced independently into ANTXR2-EGFP and the altered receptors were expressed in transiently transfected CHO-R1.1 cells.	[[172, 175], [99, 103]]	[]	['CHO', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11673	Cell viability was measured in a flow cytometry–based assay where the percentage of live, EGFP-positive cells remaining after toxin challenge was compared with cells incubated with LFN-DTA alone (no toxin killing).	[[90, 94]]	[]	['EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11674	Cells expressing cytoplasmic EGFP or ANTXR1-EGFP were included as negative controls..	[[29, 33], [44, 48]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11675	Residues G153 and L154 are located in a surface region of ANTXR2 that contacts PA domain 2 (Figure 1).	[[79, 81]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11676	To further investigate the role of this region in the D683 mutant PA interaction, we made reciprocal exchanges of the residues located between positions 152 and 157 (DGLVPS) in the β4-α4 loop region of the ANTXR2 I domain and the corresponding residues of ANTXR1 (154 to 159; HEDLFF) in the context of ANTXR1-EGFP and ANTXR2-EGFP proteins, respectively.	[[309, 313], [325, 329], [66, 68]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11677	To address the possible role of ANTXR2 in lethal toxin killing of Fischer 344 rats, we first confirmed that D683 mutant forms of PA can interact with rat ANTXR2 (rANTXR2) but not rat ANTXR1.	[[129, 131], [162, 169]]	[]	['PA', 'rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11678	Therefore, we constructed a rat version of the ANTXR1-EGFP protein (designated as ANTXR1R72,S136-EGFP by replacing these two human-specific residues with those of rat ANTXR1.	[[54, 58], [97, 101]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11679	Also, cDNAs encoding the rANTXR2 open reading frame were isolated from rat liver and brain tissue RNAs; both cDNAs had an identical DNA sequence.	[[25, 32]]	[]	['rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11680	Comparison with the human ANTXR2 (hANTXR2) revealed that the I domains of these proteins differ by ten amino acid acids, two of which are PA-contact residues: Arg111 and Ser113 in hANTXR2 are alanine and glutamine in rANTXR2, respectively (Figure S1).	[[34, 41], [180, 187], [138, 140], [217, 224]]	[]	['hANTXR2', 'hANTXR2', 'PA', 'rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11681	CHO-R1.1 cells engineered to express rANTXR2-EGFP were susceptible to PAD683K-dependent killing, albeit slightly less efficiently than the killing observed with wild-type PA (Figure 4A and 4B).	[[45, 49], [171, 173], [37, 44]]	[]	['EGFP', 'PA', 'rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11682	By contrast, cells engineered to express either hANTXR1-EGFP or ANTXR1R72,S136-EGFP were resistant to PAD683K-dependent killing.	[[56, 60], [79, 83]]	[]	['EGFP', 'EGFP']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11683	In an initial experiment, it was found that PAD683K could support lethal toxin-killing of male Fischer 344 rats, albeit several-fold less efficiently than that seen with wild-type PA: the mean time to death (TTD) (±SD) seen with three animals injected intravenously with 8 μg of LF and 10 μg of wild-type PA was 93.3 (±10.2) minutes, similar to that seen with two animals injected with four times as much PAD683K and the same amount of LF, i.e., TTD = 98.5 (±10.6) minutes.	[[279, 281], [436, 438], [180, 182], [305, 307], [208, 211], [446, 449]]	[[193, 206]]	['LF', 'LF', 'PA', 'PA', 'TTD', 'TTD']	['time to death']	PMC1617126.nxml
11684	This several-fold decrease in the efficacy of PAD683K was also apparent from comparing the mean TTD of two animals injected with 200 μg of this mutant protein and LF (TTD = 68.5 [±5.0] minutes compared to those of three animals in each group that received LF with either 20, 30, or 40 μg of wild-type PA [mean TTD = 60.3 ± 2.9; 57.0 ± 2.0; and 54.7 ± 1.5 minutes, respectively])..

11685	To investigate the relative efficacy of PAD683K in more detail, a subsequent experiment was performed with rats injected with the same amount of LF and with either a fixed amount of PAD683K (100 μg) or varying amounts of wild-type PA (ranging from 10 to 40 μg).	[[145, 147], [231, 233]]	[]	['LF', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11686	Rats injected with LF and 100 μg of PAD683K died on average approximately 67 min following toxin administration (Figure 4C).	[[19, 21]]	[]	['LF']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11687	By comparison, rats injected with LF and either 20 μg of PA or 10 μg of PA died an average of approximately 64 and 89 min after toxin injection, respectively (Figure 4C).	[[34, 36], [57, 59], [72, 74]]	[]	['LF', 'PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11688	The difference in TTD between the rats treated with 100 μg of PAD683K was statistically significant when compared with those injected with 10 μg of PA (P = 0.0001) but not from those treated with 20 μg of PA (P = 0.104) (Figure 4C).	[[148, 150], [205, 207], [18, 21]]	[]	['PA', 'PA', 'TTD']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11689	Based on these dosage effects, we conclude that PAD683K can mediate anthrax lethal toxin killing of rats, albeit with an approximately 5-fold reduced efficiency compared with wild-type PA..	[[185, 187]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11690	This report demonstrates that D683 mutant forms of PA bind selectively to ANTXR2 and that this selectivity is dependent on amino acid residues of ANTXR2 that contact domain 2 of PA.	[[51, 53]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11691	Moreover, we have shown that a D683K mutant form of PA is capable of mediating lethal toxin killing of rats, implicating an important physiological role for ANTXR2 in this process..	[[52, 54]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11692	We have demonstrated that the ability of ANTXR2 to bind PA proteins with mutations at the D683 site maps to the receptor surface region containing residues G153 and L154 that engage PA domain 2.	[[56, 58], [182, 184]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11693	Replacing the ANTXR2 G153, which allows a polypeptide backbone turn, and L154, which participates in hydrophobic interactions with PA, with the negatively charged Glu and Asp residues from ANTXR1 resulted in resistance to cellular intoxication with PAD683N.	[[131, 133]]	[]	['PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11694	First, this result could reflect the slightly reduced levels of PAD683K intoxication observed in cultured cells expressing rANTXR2 relative to those expressing hANTXR2.	[[123, 130]]	[]	['rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11695	The hANTXR2 R111 residue interacts with a negatively charged environment in PA domain 4, and the S113 residue makes H-bond contacts with PA domain 4 in the crystal structure (unpublished data) [31,32].	[[4, 11], [76, 78], [137, 139]]	[]	['hANTXR2', 'PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11696	The rANTXR2 Ala and Gln residues at these respective locations may not be able to participate in these interactions.	[[4, 11]]	[]	['rANTXR2']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11697	A second possibility is that cell type–specific differences downstream of initial PA binding might dictate different activities of PA proteins with altered residues at the D683 site.	[[82, 84], [131, 133]]	[]	['PA', 'PA']	[]	PMC1617126.nxml
11698	This ANTXR2-specific form of PA can now be used to study the role of ANTXR2 in mediating the effects of lethal toxin in other cell types, and it can also be engineered into the bacterium to probe the importance of this receptor for various aspects of anthrax disease pathogenesis following infection with B.

[[129, 131]]	[]	['LB']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11755	In contrast to growth on swarm plates containing LB broth, these nutrient-limited conditions likely result in the accumulation of RpoS owing to decreased replication rates and induction of the stringent response [22].	[[49, 51]]	[]	['LB']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml

11757	The motility phenotype of the hapR mutant on LB swarm plates corroborates previous data by Yildiz et al., who demonstrated an 80% reduction of motility of the hapR mutant under the same conditions of growth [36].	[[45, 47]]	[]	['LB']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11758	These data also suggest that the flagella seen by SEM in stationary phase cultures of the rpoS mutant had been formed during early and mid-exponential phase growth.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['SEM']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11759	Based on cell density measurements and the fraction of rpoS mutant bacteria with flagella (as determined by SEM during stationary phase), flagella production by this mutant appears to occur at cell densities below OD600 = 0.9 in LB media.	[[229, 231], [108, 111]]	[]	['LB', 'SEM']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11760	We also hypothesized that this too might require RpoS, owing to its capacity to increase the production of HapR [31], which negatively regulates genes specifying CT and TCP [14].	[[162, 164], [169, 172]]	[]	['CT', 'TCP']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11761	To test this idea we measured the concentration of CT in cultures containing either the rpoS mutant or the wild-type parent during growth in an vitro condition previously shown to strongly induce the genes encoding CT and TCP [46].	[[51, 53], [215, 217], [222, 225]]	[]	['CT', 'CT', 'TCP']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11762	In contrast, the rpoS mutant produced comparatively more CT throughout the static growth period, eventually achieving more than 10-fold higher concentrations than the wild-type parent.	[[57, 59]]	[]	['CT']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11763	This coincided with increased ctxA and tcpA transcript levels in the rpoS mutant during the third and fourth hour of incubation in the static cultures (unpublished data) indicating that the accumulation of CT in this medium and at these time points is likely due to increased transcription of the corresponding genes rather than increased secretion or decreased degradation of CT.	[[206, 208]]	[]	['CT']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml
11764	During the aerobic phase of the assay period, CT concentrations declined in the wild-type culture, whereas the concentration of CT remained high in the rpoS mutant culture (Figure 6A).	[[46, 48], [128, 130]]	[]	['CT', 'CT']	[]	PMC1617127.nxml

11767	Although RpoS was also shown to be required for reduced production of CT in an in vitro condition that induces expression of genes coding for CT and TCP (Figure 6A), evidence is suggestive, but not as compelling, that this occurs in vivo coincidental with the mucosal escape response (Figure 6B and 6C).

11797	While transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in small ruminants and humans are believed to involve distinct prion strains [1,2], a single prion strain has been associated so far with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [3–6].

11799	However, the biochemical testing of the brains of slaughtered and fallen cattle, which was intensified since 2000 in European countries as a means to protect the consumers, has led to the discovery of positive samples that showed distinct PrPres profiles.	[[239, 245]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11800	These atypical profiles have been sorted into two groups so far, provisionally termed H-type when the size of the protease resistant fragments is higher than for BSE, and bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy, or L-type, when it is lower [9,10].

11807	Such a discrepancy could reflect a lesser infectivity of H-type samples, consistent with their comparatively lower PrPres content [9].	[[115, 121]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11808	Moreover, the survival time was reduced by ~100 d on subpassage, approaching that for BSE from cattle or other sources on secondary passage, or on primary passage for inocula of presumably higher titre (i.e., producing no substantial reduction of survival time on subpassage: BSE no.

11816	A further difference was the lack of detectable PrPres in the spleen of H-type diseased tgOv mice (three to five spleens tested per isolate), while this accumulated at substantial levels after BSE or vCJD infection (Figure 2B)..	[[193, 196], [48, 54], [200, 204]]	[]	['BSE', 'PrPres', 'vCJD']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11817	We next examined the PrPres targeting and the vacuolation in the brain, which are known to exhibit a strain-dependent variation [6,15,16].	[[21, 27]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11818	This was performed on tgBov mice since they express a PrPC homologous to that of the donors, including the number of octarepeats [17], thus providing a relevant context for comparing H-type and epizootic BSE isolates.	[[204, 207]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11819	H-type isolates showed a similar distribution of PrPres deposits on both primary and secondary transmission, as assessed by histoblotting on brain coronal sections (Figure 3A–3B).	[[49, 55]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11820	The staining did not differ from that seen with cattle BSE in several regions, such as the striatum and several nuclei of the thalamus, including the geniculate, ventral postero-lateral and -medial as well as the brain stem (Figure 3A–3C and data not shown).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11821	However, other areas such as the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum including the cingulum, the dorsal commissure, the alveus, and fimbria of the hippocampus were predominantly stained with H-type, whereas BSE PrPres was rather confined in the stratum oriens of the hippocampus (Figure 3A–3C).	[[208, 211], [212, 218]]	[]	['BSE', 'PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11822	While immunochemistry revealed various types of PrP deposits in both cases, thin diffuse PrP deposits were predominant in H-type–infected brains, whereas the most frequent type was granular in BSE-infected mouse brains.	[[193, 196]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11823	Overall, the vacuolation was much more intense in the case of H-type variant (Figures 3 and 4): areas such as the septum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cortex showed severe spongiosis, accompanied by a pronounced reactive glial astrocytosis based on GFAP staining (not shown), while BSE-induced vacuolation was moderate in the same areas..	[[284, 287]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11824	We finally examined whether H-type isolates may have an ovine TSE origin.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11825	The PrPres molecular profile observed in the brain of SSit-diseased mice (more than four brains analysed per isolate) was characterised by a significantly higher apparent molecular mass (difference of 0.7 ± 0.2 kDa) and a slightly higher proportion of diglycosylated PrPres as compared with H-type–derived PrPres (Figure 5A–5C).	[[4, 10], [267, 273], [306, 312]]	[]	['PrPres', 'PrPres', 'PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11826	Another difference was again the pronounced accumulation of SSit-associated PrPres in the spleen, while this was still impaired in H-type–infected mice, even after two passages (three to five spleens tested per combination; Figures 2B and 5A)..	[[76, 82]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11827	We then compared by histoblot distribution and nature of PrPres deposits within the brains of tgOv mice infected with a second passage of H-type (no.	[[57, 63]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11828	Indeed, large plaques of SSit-associated PrPres were present in the pretectal nuclei and in related structures of the limbic system such the fornix, the alveus, fimbria, and subiculum of the hippocampus.	[[41, 47]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11829	H-type–associated PrPres was detected instead in the corpus callosum, cortex, and ventromedial thalamic nuclei (Figure 5D and unpublished data).	[[18, 24]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11830	In conclusion, these data suggest that the H-type agent is unrelated to the ovine TSE isolates transmitted so far to our transgenic lines..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11831	In this study we show that cattle brain samples positive for abnormal PrP with a distinct molecular pattern, called H-type, consistently produces a fatal, TSE-like disease upon inoculation to both bovine and ovine PrP transgenic mice.	[[155, 158]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11832	These results, corroborating the recent transmission to wild-type mice [18], formally establish that such cases involve an authentic TSE infectious agent.	[[133, 136]]	[]	['TSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11833	Importantly, we provide detailed evidence that this newly recognised agent differs from epizootic BSE agent derived from cattle or other species..	[[98, 101]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11834	Both molecular and biological criteria support the conclusion that H-type and BSE agents are distinct prion strains.	[[78, 81]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11835	Thus, while primary transmission to tgOv mice led to longer survival times for both agents, the increase relative to tgBov mice was significantly less for H-type than for BSE-type agents (Figure 1).	[[171, 174]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11836	Second, the molecular profiles of the PrPres fragments detected in the brain of diseased mice were clearly distinguishable in either line.	[[38, 44]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11837	Third, unlike that for BSE agents, no PrPres signal could be seen in the spleen of H-type–infected tgOv mice, indicative of a stronger neurotropism at least in this host.	[[23, 26], [38, 44]]	[]	['BSE', 'PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11838	Typically, severe spongiosis and diffuse PrP deposition were present in several areas of H-type–infected brains, while the same areas of BSE-infected brains showed limited spongiosis together with marked PrP deposition.	[[137, 140]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11839	The isolation from cattle of a prion strain distinct from the one implicated in the BSE epidemics raises several concerns.	[[84, 87]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11840	In this regards, the better compatibility between ovine PrP sequence and H-type as compared to BSE was intriguing (Figure 1).	[[95, 98]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11841	However, the PrPres molecular profile, nature of deposits, and distribution within the brain as well as the differential accumulation in the spleen strongly distinguish H-type and SSit isolates.	[[13, 19]]	[]	['PrPres']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11842	H-type and BSE agents might be related despite their distinguishable phenotypes.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11843	The isolation of an additional strain upon exposure of transgenic or wild-type mice to the epizootic BSE agent has been reported [21], thus questioning its strain homogeneity.	[[101, 104]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11844	Also, molecular typing studies have revealed the presence of a minor, non–BSE-type PrPres component in BSE- and vCJD-infected brains [22].	[[74, 77], [103, 106], [83, 89], [112, 116]]	[]	['BSE', 'BSE', 'PrPres', 'vCJD']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11845	Hence, H-type isolates could arise from the preferential amplification in certain individuals of a subcomponent present in BSE infectious sources.	[[123, 126]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11846	Comparing H-type and BSE-derived variant prions identified in mice might be informative in that respect..	[[21, 24]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11847	Indeed, an implication of this latter scenario is that such bovine “atypical” cases could occur in countries free of BSE exposure.	[[117, 120]]	[]	['BSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml
11848	The acquisition of novel properties by an endogenous, sporadic cattle TSE agent, as occasioned on passage through an intermediary host or a physicochemical treatment such as that applied to carcass-derived products, has been invoked as one possible origin for the emergence of BSE epidemics [7].	[[277, 280], [70, 73]]	[]	['BSE', 'TSE']	[]	PMC1617128.nxml

11892	It was further evident that type I strains express much less cyst wall and BAG1 protein in response to treatment with Compound 1 or culture in alkaline pH (Figure S1A and S1B), and it is difficult to detect the induction of BAG1 or bradyzoite-specific LDH2 mRNAs in type I strains (Figure S1C).

11893	A ligand binding assay using tritiated Compound 1 initially identified cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as a target in type I RH parasites [18], and transgenic RH parasites expressing mutant PKG were resistant to Compound 1 control as reflected by increased virulence in mice and parasite mass in cell culture [20,34].	[[102, 105], [194, 197]]	[]	['PKG', 'PKG']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11894	Recently, however, it has been shown that Compound 1 directly inhibits extracellular gliding motility and the invasion of RH parasites into HFF cells but not in transgenic RH parasites expressing a drug-resistant PKG allele [35]—suggesting that the alteration of parasite mobility and invasion by Compound 1 is the major action of this drug within the parasite.

[[250, 253], [110, 113], [49, 53], [214, 218], [132, 135]]	[[90, 108], [116, 130]]	['HFF', 'LPS', 'MAPK', 'MAPK', 'PMA']	['lipopolysaccharide', 'phorbol esters']	PMC1626100.nxml
11906	Moreover, combinations of parasite infection and LPS treatment were unable to induce p38 phosphorylation above levels observed in the untreated control (Figure S2A).	[[49, 52]]	[]	['LPS']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11907	Thus, while we cannot yet exclude a potential role for p38 (and its inhibition) in the observed effects of Compound 1 and other MAPK inhibitors in this cell type, these results suggest that other biochemical pathways play a significant role..	[[128, 132]]	[]	['MAPK']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11908	To identify the host cell mRNAs affecting the observed induction of parasite BAG1 or cyst wall protein, we used a multivariate series of DNA microarray hybridizations (defined in Table 1) on RNA samples obtained from treated HFF cells (prior to infection) and we correlated changes in the levels of host cell mRNAs with distinct developmental outcomes that were obtained by subsequent parasite infections (the full design of these experiments and list of the final genes along with normalized levels for each condition is published in Table S1).	[[77, 81], [225, 228]]	[]	['BAG1', 'HFF']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11909	By identifying those host mRNAs whose levels were altered in predictable ways with respect to the treatment regimens to induce parasite BAG1 expression, we were able to reduce the relevant number of potential host cell mRNAs.	[[136, 140]]	[]	['BAG1']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11910	In Table 1, the range of host mRNAs from successive queries of the database drops from 37,000 possible genes on the array to 79 when the analyses combine Compound 1 induction with recovery for 6 or 12 h prior to infection, with the noninductive effects of DRB and 506126, and with the antagonism of Compound 1 by DRB and SB202190.

11911	Hybridization signals for CDA1 were up 47-fold in Compound 1–pretreated host cells but were nearly unchanged in cells where the effects of Compound 1 induction were antagonized by DRB and SB202190.	[[180, 183]]	[]	['DRB']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11912	To test the relevance of CDA1 to the observed Compound 1–induced growth inhibition and BAG1 expression in the parasite, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) SmartPool (Dharmakon, Lafayette, Colorado, United States) consisting of four distinct siRNAs against various regions of the CDA1 coding sequence, to knock down mRNA levels in Compound 1–pretreated HFF cells.

11913	VEG parasites were then introduced into this environment, and parasite vacuole size and the level of BAG1 expression were evaluated at 48 h postinfection.	[[101, 105]]	[]	['BAG1']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11914	It was evident that the inhibition of parasite growth that occurs under Compound 1 was dramatically reversed by siRNA knockdown of CDA1 since parasite replication in these host cells was nearly equivalent to untreated controls (Figure 3A).	[[112, 117]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11915	Similarly, the knockdown of CDA1 mRNA reduced BAG1 expression to 16% of vacuoles from greater than 60% under Compound 1 alone (Figure 3A).	[[46, 50]]	[]	['BAG1']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11916	This result was specific to CDA1 siRNA, as siRNA knockdown of Lamin A/C in HFF cells (Figure 3B) was unable to reverse Compound 1 inhibition of parasite growth or the elevation of BAG1 expression (unpublished data).

11918	Transfection of HFF cells with LipofectAMINE or CDA1 siRNA alone was not found to influence parasite growth or induce BAG1 expression (unpublished data)..	[[118, 122], [16, 19], [53, 58]]	[]	['BAG1', 'HFF', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11919	We tested each individual siRNA in the CDA1 Smartpool separately to corroborate the initial collective observations (Figure 3C) and determined that the siRNAs designated 1 and 4 did not reverse the growth inhibition of 3-h Compound 1 pretreatment.	[[26, 31], [152, 157]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11920	In contrast, siRNAs 2 and 3 alone were each able to abrogate the growth inhibitory effects of the Compound 1 treatment and allow VEG parasites to reach vacuole sizes that were 72% and 78% of that attained by the complete Smartpool (81% of untreated controls, Figure 3C).	[[13, 18]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11921	Antagonism of the Compound 1–induced growth inhibition with siRNAs 2 and 3 was dose dependent as the effectiveness of each siRNA to antagonize the Compound 1 effect was diminished at 50 and 25 nM concentrations (unpublished data).	[[60, 65], [123, 128]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11922	Parasite development in HFF cells cultured in alkaline pH is only effective when maintained for long periods; thus, the single transfection of CDA1 siRNAs was much less effective when parasites were continually exposed to either Compound 1 or alkaline media (pH 8.2).	[[24, 27], [148, 153]]	[]	['HFF', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11923	Interferon γ (100 U/ml) was unable to significantly inhibit parasite growth in HFF cultures treated prior to parasite infection or with continuous exposure after infection (unpublished data), a finding consistent with reported resistance of HFF cells to this cytokine [21,41]..	[[79, 82], [241, 244]]	[]	['HFF', 'HFF']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11924	Other published methods to trigger bradyzoite formation may also act through the host as we have found that long-term preconditioning of HFF cells in alkaline media can induce some bradyzoite gene expression in parasites that invade this altered environment but are then maintained under physiological pH.	[[137, 140]]	[]	['HFF']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11925	Parasite growth and the expression of acknowledged bradyzoite-specific BAG1 and cyst wall mRNA and proteins in the Compound 1 and pH-altered HFF environment are consistent with elevated levels of these mRNAs in in vivo cysts [46] and during sporozoite initiated development [47] and suggest we have described an authentic bradyzoite development pathway..	[[71, 75], [141, 144]]	[]	['BAG1', 'HFF']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11926	It is intriguing that type I RH and GT-1 parasites were resistant to the Compound 1–altered host cell environment and were unable to slow growth significantly, express BAG1, or assemble a cyst wall.	[[168, 172]]	[]	['BAG1']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11927	Through the use of siRNA knockdown methods, we have confirmed that increased expression of at least one of the host genes altered by Compound 1 is required to arrest the parasite cell cycle and induce bradyzoite gene expression.	[[19, 24]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1626100.nxml
11928	Tachyzoites of VEG (type III strain), ME49 (type II strain), and RH and GT-1 strains (both type I) were maintained separately by serial passage in HFF, and these cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, New York, United States) supplemented with 1% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah, United States) as previously described [8].

11982	For instance, the K5 modulator of immune recognition (MIR2) from Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus prevents activation of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells by downregulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, the MHC-like molecule CD1, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and PECAM, and the co-stimulatory molecule B7.2.

11986	Since ALCAM is the ligand for CD6, a member of the immunological synapse of T cells, its removal by viral immune modulators implies a role for CD6 in the recognition of pathogens by T cells.	[[6, 11]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml

12007	In three independent repeat experiments we observed that MHC I, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2), and Syntaxin-4 were consistently reduced in plasma membranes of K5-expressing cells, whereas only K5 itself was increased in any fraction.

12008	While reduced MHC I expression was expected, none of the other proteins were previously known to be affected by K5.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12009	Most targets of K5 are ubiquitinated in a post-ER compartment and then sorted to endosomes in a clathrin-dependent process [30].	[[47, 49]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12010	We recently showed, however, that newly synthesized CD31/PECAM is degraded by K5 prior to ER exit by ER-associated proteasomal degradation [19].	[[90, 92], [101, 103]]	[]	['ER', 'ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12011	For these reasons, we wanted to measure changes in the proteome of the plasma membrane, the Golgi membrane, and the ER membrane..	[[116, 118]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12012	K5-mediated downregulation of MHC I was confirmed by flow cytometry 24 h post-infection (unpublished data).	[[30, 33]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12013	To minimize variation due to biochemical procedures, plasma membrane, ER, and Golgi fractions were generated by sucrose gradient separation after lysis of the combined labeled and unlabeled cells (Figure 1).	[[70, 72]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12014	Tryptic peptides from the resulting fractions were separated by two sequential chromatography steps (strong cation and reverse phase) prior to analysis by MS using an LCQ ion-trap instrument in data-dependent MS/MS mode.	[[155, 157], [212, 214]]	[]	['MS', 'MS']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12015	To discriminate true assignments of MS/MS spectra to peptide sequences from false assignments, we applied PeptideProphet software using a score of 0.85 as the cutoff value for each identified peptide [32]..	[[39, 41]]	[]	['MS']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12016	The ER and the Golgi fraction contained both bona fide ER- and Golgi-resident proteins and many plasma membrane or transmembrane proteins, presumably en route to the cell surface.	[[4, 6], [55, 57]]	[]	['ER', 'ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12017	Using these criteria, only one protein changed in the ER and Golgi fractions.	[[54, 56]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12018	Among this list were peptides mapping to the HLA-A01 allele, which were present in significantly lower amounts in the plasma membrane fraction, but not in the ER or Golgi fractions.	[[159, 161]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12019	The lack of statistically significant MHC I downregulation in the ER fraction is consistent with the observation that MHC I assembly in the ER is not affected by K5 [9,10].	[[66, 68], [140, 142], [38, 41], [118, 121]]	[]	['ER', 'ER', 'MHC', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12020	Since both internal controls—transduced K5 as well as the K5 target protein MHC I—were successfully identified as displaying altered ratios, we anticipated that the three remaining proteins in the plasma membrane fraction had a high chance of being true positive results..	[[76, 79]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12021	Each of these three proteins was not previously identified as downregulated by K5: BST-2 (also known as HM1.24 and CD316), Syntaxin-4, and ALCAM (CD166).	[[139, 144], [83, 88]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12022	Despite this topological difference and lack of relationship to other K5 targets, BST-2 was consistently scored as the most strongly underrepresented protein in K5-expressing cells (Table 1).	[[82, 87]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12023	A dramatic reduction of BST-2 expression was confirmed in immunoblot of Ad-K5-infected HeLa cells, whereas BST-2 was unaffected in Mock- or Ad-WT-infected cells (Figure 3A).	[[24, 29], [107, 112]]	[]	['BST-2', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12024	BST-2 expression was also strongly reduced upon adenovirus-mediated expression of the human K5 homolog MARCH-VIII, but was less affected by the HIV protein vpu, which recruits a cellular ubiquitin ligase.	[[103, 108]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12025	To determine whether downregulation of BST-2 required the ubiquitin ligase activity of K5, we transfected a catalytically inactive mutant of K5 (K5-RING) that lacks two critical cysteines in the K5-RING domain [38], and monitored BST-2 expression by immunoblot.	[[39, 44], [230, 235]]	[]	['BST-2', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12026	While transiently transfected K5 was still able to downregulate BST-2, the K5-RING construct showed no effect despite significantly higher levels of expression (Figure 3B).	[[64, 69]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12027	Whether this reduction of BST-2 levels is a direct consequence of K5 ubiquitinating BST-2, or an indirect consequence of the downregulation of other proteins by K5, has not yet been established.	[[26, 31], [84, 89]]	[]	['BST-2', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12028	However, these experiments clearly confirm that BST-2 protein levels are reduced in K5-expressing cells and demonstrate that this reduction requires catalytically active K5..	[[48, 53]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12029	Syntaxins belong to the target-membrane-associated soluble N-ethylmaleimide fusion protein attachment protein receptor (t-SNARE) family and are responsible for correctly targeting and fusing intracellular vesicles during transport [39].	[[120, 127]]	[]	['t-SNARE']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12030	Syntaxin-4 is a plasma membrane–localized t-SNARE and mediates docking of transport vesicles at the cell surface.	[[42, 49]]	[]	['t-SNARE']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12031	Interestingly, Syntaxin-6, a Golgi-localized t-SNARE, was previously observed to associate with MARCH-II and MARCH-III, human homologs of K5 [40,41].	[[96, 101], [109, 114], [45, 52]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH', 't-SNARE']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12032	To confirm the reduction of Syntaxin-4 protein in K5-expressing cells and to determine whether K5 or any of the MARCH proteins associate with Syntaxin-4, we performed immunoblots and immunofluorescence experiments.	[[112, 117]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12033	Interestingly, Syntaxin-4 levels were also reduced upon expression of MARCH-VIII, but not upon expression of vpu, suggesting that Syntaxin-4 is specifically targeted by transmembrane RING-CH proteins.	[[70, 75]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12034	In contrast, significant co-localization was observed upon transfection of all MARCH proteins, except for MARCH-III and a naturally occurring truncated splicing product to MARCH-IX (“−RING” in Figure 4B) [14].	[[79, 84], [106, 111], [172, 177]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12035	Moreover, Syntaxin-4 seemed to be enriched in the subcellular compartments corresponding to the subcellular localization previously shown for the MARCH proteins [14].	[[146, 151]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12036	Thus, MARCH-IV and MARCH-VIII relocated Syntaxin-4 to the Golgi and endosomes, respectively.	[[6, 11], [19, 24]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12037	Since these results are similar to the previously reported binding of Syntaxin-6 to MARCH-II and MARCH-III [40,41], it seems highly likely that Syntaxin-4 also interacts with the MARCH proteins with which it co-localizes..	[[84, 89], [97, 102], [179, 184]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12038	However, Syntaxin-4 levels are also reduced in MARCH-VIII-expressing cells, yet MARCH-VIII clearly associates with Syntaxin-4.	[[47, 52], [80, 85]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12039	Alternatively, it could be that only the minor fraction of K5 that traffics to the plasma membrane [19] interacts with Syntaxin-4, whereas the major, ER-localized population of K5 molecules is unable to do so.	[[150, 152]]	[]	['ER']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12040	To determine whether ER exit was the determining factor for co-localization with Syntaxin-4, we generated truncated versions of MARCH proteins that were unable to leave the ER.	[[21, 23], [128, 133]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12041	Previous work has demonstrated that a carboxy-terminal PDZ motif in MARCH proteins is required for their forward transport since deletion of the final four amino acids resulted in ER retention of MARCH-II and MARCH-III [40,41].	[[180, 182], [68, 73], [196, 201], [209, 214]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12042	While we could not confirm such a role for the carboxy-terminal 45 amino acids in MARCH-VIII, we did observe that MARCH-VIII truncated by 62 or 74 amino acids was unable to exit the ER (Figure 4C).	[[182, 184], [82, 87], [114, 119]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12043	Importantly, ER-resident MARCH-VIII mutants did not interact with Syntaxin-4.	[[13, 15], [25, 30]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12044	This raised the possibility that Syntaxin-4 regulates ER exit of MARCH-VIII by binding within the 16 residues that differ between the Δ46 and Δ62 mutants.	[[54, 56], [65, 70]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12045	Small interfering RNA knockdown of Syntaxin-4, however, had no effect on MARCH-VIII localization (unpublished data), so we consider this hypothesis unlikely.	[[73, 78]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12046	Therefore, we conclude that Syntaxin-4 associates only with MARCH proteins that have left the ER.	[[60, 65]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12047	Our data further suggest that K5 and MARCH proteins not only interact with, but also degrade syntaxins.	[[37, 42]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12048	Using transfection of a hemagglutinin epitope (HA)–tagged construct, we confirmed that K5 very efficiently eliminated ALCAM-HA upon co-transfection (Figure 5A).	[[118, 123], [47, 49], [124, 126]]	[[24, 45]]	['ALCAM', 'HA', 'HA']	['hemagglutinin epitope']	PMC1626102.nxml
12049	Additionally, downregulation of ALCAM from the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry of HeLa cells transduced with Ad-K5.	[[32, 37]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12050	In contrast to ALCAM, K5 did not alter surface expression of CD9 or CD29 (Figure 5B).	[[15, 20]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12051	The co-stimulatory function of ALCAM renders this molecule an attractive target for viral immune modulators.	[[31, 36]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12052	To determine whether other viral K3 family proteins target ALCAM, we transfected KSHV-K3 and the myxomavirus homolog M153R and monitored ALCAM expression by flow cytometry.	[[59, 64], [137, 142], [81, 85]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM', 'KSHV']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12053	Interestingly, M153R clearly reduced ALCAM surface levels, whereas the K3 protein, the most closely related K5 homolog, did not affect ALCAM (Figure 5C).	[[37, 42], [135, 140]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12054	This result is consistent with previous observations that K3 targets are limited to classical and nonclassical MHC I–like molecules [9,10,20], whereas both K5 and M153 display broader substrate specificity [12,21,22].	[[111, 114]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12055	Within the MARCH family, MARCH-IV and MARCH-IX downregulated ALCAM to a significant degree, while a modest effect was observed with MARCH-VIII (Figure 5C).	[[61, 66], [11, 16], [25, 30], [38, 43], [132, 137]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12056	The RING and transmembrane domains of MARCH-IV and MARCH-IX are highly homologous to each other, and this result is consistent with previous observations showing that the range of substrates for these two MARCH proteins overlaps with that of K5 [14]..	[[38, 43], [51, 56], [205, 210]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12057	The catalytically inactive K5-RING construct [38], as well as a K5 construct lacking acidic clusters in its carboxy-terminal domain (K5DE12) [19,46], did not affect surface expression of ALCAM (Figure 5C).	[[187, 192]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12058	These data suggest that downregulation of ALCAM requires the ubiquitin ligase activity and proper subcellular targeting of K5..	[[42, 47]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12059	To investigate whether ALCAM downregulation occurs in KSHV-infected endothelial cells, we took advantage of the fact that K5 is not expressed in latently infected dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs), but can be induced upon addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates the lytic cycle [19].

12060	As shown previously, PMA treatment reduced expression of MHC I on the cell surface of KSHV-infected DMVECs, but not uninfected DMVECs (Figure 5D).	[[100, 105], [127, 132], [86, 90], [57, 60], [21, 24]]	[]	['DMVEC', 'DMVEC', 'KSHV', 'MHC', 'PMA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12061	The mean florescence of ALCAM was unchanged in latently infected DMVECs, but was reduced approximately 2-fold upon PMA treatment.	[[24, 29], [65, 70], [115, 118]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'DMVEC', 'PMA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12062	In contrast, levels of CD81, a multiple transmembrane-spanning plasma membrane protein that is elevated in latently infected cells, did not change upon PMA treatment.	[[152, 155]]	[]	['PMA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12063	Since PMA treatment does not induce lytic gene expression, and hence K5 expression, in all of the KSHV-infected cells [47], the actual levels of downregulation of both MHC I and ALCAM might be considerably higher in individual cells.

12064	The correlation of ALCAM downregulation and K5 expression, however, renders it highly likely that virally expressed K5 is causing this effect..	[[19, 24]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12065	Taken together, these data suggested that ALCAM is a bona fide substrate for the viral ubiquitin ligase K5.	[[42, 47]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12066	To confirm that ALCAM downregulation involved K5-dependent conjugation of ubiquitin, we transfected HeLa cells with ALCAM-HA either in the presence or absence of Ad-K5.	[[16, 21], [116, 121], [122, 124]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM', 'HA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml

12071	In the presence of K5, however, substantially increased levels of ubiquitinated ALCAM-HA were observed, consistent with K5-mediated ubiquitination of ALCAM.	[[80, 85], [86, 88]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'HA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12072	Acidic motif–deleted K5 and HIV-vpu had no effect, whereas MARCH-VIII slightly increased ALCAM-HA ubiquitination, consistent with the slight downregulation of endogenous ALCAM observed by flow cytometry..	[[89, 94], [170, 175], [95, 97], [59, 64]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM', 'HA', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12073	To determine which degradation system was responsible for ALCAM degradation, we followed the maturation and degradation of ALCAM-HA using pulse-chase analysis in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors or inhibitors of endosomal acidification.	[[58, 63], [123, 128], [129, 131]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM', 'HA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12074	In the absence of K5, ALCAM-HA acquired complete resistance to endoglycosidase H within 2 h post-labeling, indicating its intracellular transport through the Golgi complex (Figure 6B).	[[22, 27], [28, 30]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'HA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12075	After chasing for 8 h, ALCAM-HA levels remained high in control cells, showing only a minor reduction due to endogenous turnover.	[[23, 28], [29, 31]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'HA']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12076	Expression of K5 did not alter ALCAM biosynthesis or trafficking through the Golgi; however, amounts of endoglycosidase H–resistant ALCAM were significantly reduced, consistent with a post-Golgi degradation mechanism.	[[31, 36], [132, 137]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12077	K5-dependent degradation of ALCAM was inhibited by inhibiting lysosomal acidification with concanamycin A but not by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132.	[[28, 33]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12078	To determine whether ALCAM is targeted to lysosomes via the MVB pathway, we co-transfected K5 with a dominant negative version of the AAA-ATPase Vps4 (Vps4mut), which prevents MVB formation [48].	[[21, 26], [60, 63], [176, 179]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'MVB', 'MVB']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12079	Expression of dominant negative Vps4 partially restored surface expression of both MHC I and ALCAM measured using flow cytometry, whereas wild-type Vps4 had only a minor effect (Figure 6C).	[[93, 98], [83, 86]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12080	Taken together, these data indicate that K5 ubiquitinates ALCAM in a post-ER compartment, thus triggering ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and targeting of ALCAM for lysosomal destruction via the MVB pathway.	[[58, 63], [154, 159], [74, 76], [194, 197]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'ALCAM', 'ER', 'MVB']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12081	Since this mechanism is similar to that of other K5 targets, we conclude that ALCAM is a novel substrate for K5 as well as a target for M153R.	[[78, 83]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12082	To this end, we applied SILAC, a quantitative proteomics method based on metabolic isotope labeling.	[[24, 29]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12083	Until now, the SILAC method was mainly used for global comparative proteomics experiments expected to yield a relatively large number of changes, such as the comparison of cell surface proteins from T helper 1 versus T helper 2 cells [49], differential protein secretion from cancer versus normal cells [50], proteins associated with stimulation of a given receptor [51], or changes in substrates trapped by a mutant protease complex upon stress activation [52].	[[15, 20]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12084	To our knowledge, however, this is the first time SILAC has been used in an experiment where only a few protein changes were expected.	[[50, 55]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12085	For these reasons, protein quantitation in SILAC experiments is usually limited to proteins that are identified by two or more peptides (e.g., [52]).	[[43, 48]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12086	The rate of false negatives—the proteins that were affected by K5 but were eliminated by these selection criteria—is difficult to gauge since only a few of the known K5 targets (MHC I and ICAM-1) are present in HeLa cells.	[[178, 181]]	[]	['MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12087	Using specific antibodies as well as epitope tagging, we confirmed the K5-dependent reduction in protein abundance for BST-2, Syntaxin-4, and ALCAM in independent experiments.	[[142, 147], [119, 124]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12088	Of these proteins, only BST-2 was unrelated to protein families previously shown to interact with or be targeted by the MARCH family or K3 family proteins.	[[24, 29], [120, 125]]	[]	['BST-2', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12089	Downregulation of BST-2 required the ubiquitin ligase function of K5, suggesting that the reduced expression of BST-2 is linked to the enzymatic function of K5.	[[18, 23], [112, 117]]	[]	['BST-2', 'BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12090	However, we have not ruled out the possibility that BST-2 levels are indirectly affected by another protein that is targeted by K5.	[[52, 57]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12091	Thus, one of the limitations of the SILAC approach is that it does not discriminate between proteins that are targeted directly and those that are targeted indirectly by the transmembrane ubiquitin ligases.	[[36, 41]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12092	This limitation could possibly be overcome by combining the SILAC analysis with proteomic analysis of ubiquitinated proteins [53,54].	[[60, 65]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12093	Further experiments will be needed to determine whether BST-2 is a bona fide target of K5 or related molecules.	[[56, 61]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12094	If so, it could be that BST-2 plays an as yet unknown role in immune defense..	[[24, 29]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12095	The identification of Syntaxin-4 by the SILAC method was surprising for several reasons.	[[40, 45]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12096	First, the K5-induced changes in Syntaxin-4 levels were relatively modest compared to those for MHC I, ALCAM, or BST-2.	[[103, 108], [96, 99]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12097	This demonstrates that even moderately changing proteins can be identified by SILAC, provided these changes can be measured reproducibly.	[[78, 83]]	[]	['SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12098	Second, previous observations with MARCH proteins indicated that syntaxins interact with this protein family, but evidence for degradation was not reported.	[[35, 40]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12099	As discussed above for BST-2, it might therefore be that K5 mediates degradation of Syntaxin-4 through an indirect mechanism.	[[23, 28]]	[]	['BST-2']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12100	However, the co-localization of Syntaxin-4 with all MARCH proteins that locate to post-ER compartments renders it likely that Syntaxin-4 interaction is a general feature of the entire protein family, including K5.	[[87, 89], [52, 57]]	[]	['ER', 'MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12101	Syntaxin-4 thus joins a growing list of vesicular trafficking regulators interacting with MARCH family or K3 family proteins.	[[90, 95]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12102	In addition to the above-mentioned Golgi t-SNARE Syntaxin-6 that interacts with MARCH-II and MARCH-III, this list includes the COP-I adaptor protein PACS-2 [19] and the ER/cis-Golgi-located adaptor protein Vap-A (R.	[[80, 85], [93, 98], [41, 48]]	[]	['MARCH', 'MARCH', 't-SNARE']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12103	One could therefore speculate that, by degrading Syntaxin-4, KSHV prevents the secretion of immune stimulatory chemokines or cytokines.	[[61, 65]]	[]	['KSHV']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12104	It is therefore conceivable that the degradation of Syntaxin-4 by endogenous MARCH proteins plays a role in the turnover of Syntaxin-4, thus regulating exocytosis..	[[77, 82]]	[]	['MARCH']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12105	The final novel protein identified by our SILAC screen was ALCAM (CD166).	[[59, 64], [42, 47]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'SILAC']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12106	Similar to other proteins downregulated by K5, ALCAM is a type I glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily.	[[47, 52]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12107	Several lines of evidence suggest that ALCAM is a bona fide target of K5.	[[39, 44]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12108	Similar to other K5 target molecules, ALCAM was ubiquitinated and targeted to lysosomes via the MVB pathway.	[[38, 43], [96, 99]]	[]	['ALCAM', 'MVB']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12109	Most likely, K5 ubiquitinates ALCAM at the plasma membrane, resulting in ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal destruction..	[[30, 35]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12110	In addition, we observed that the myxomavirus protein M153R downregulated ALCAM, likely by a similar mechanism, although this has not been experimentally verified.	[[74, 79]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12111	While the predominant reason for this lack of T cell recognition is likely the downregulation of MHC I from the cell surface, Coscoy and Ganem showed that the elimination of B7.2 and ICAM-1 further reduces T cell receptor (TCR) signaling [21].	[[97, 100], [223, 226]]	[]	['MHC', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12112	It was thus concluded that the combined effect of preventing both the primary signal via the TCR and the co-stimulatory signals via LFA-1 and CD28, the respective ligands of ICAM-1 and B7.2, minimizes T cell activation by KSHV-infected B cells.	[[222, 226], [93, 96]]	[]	['KSHV', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12113	Specifically, LFA-1 forms a ring around the synapse, whereas CD28 and CD6 co-localize with the TCR in the center of the synapse [43].	[[95, 98]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12114	It is generally believed that this supramolecular structure is required for the sustained TCR engagement needed to generate the full repertoire of T cell responses, including signal transduction, cytokine generation, and cell proliferation [57].	[[90, 93]]	[]	['TCR']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12115	Although the function of CD6 has not been studied as extensively as that of LFA-1 and CD28, there is accumulating evidence that the CD6–ALCAM interaction contributes to formation and function of the immunological synapse.	[[136, 141]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12116	It has been shown that antibodies to CD6 activate T cells [58] and that CD6-blocking antibodies or recombinant ALCAM-Fc proteins inhibit T cell proliferation induced by dendritic cells [45].	[[111, 116]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12117	Taken together, these observations strongly support the notion that, by downregulating ALCAM, K5 and M153R further optimize the ability of their respective viruses to prevent T cell activation.	[[87, 92]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml
12118	Moreover, the finding that ALCAM is eliminated by immune modulators from both herpesviruses and poxviruses suggests that the ALCAM–CD6 ligand receptor pair plays a previously unappreciated role in anti-viral immunity..	[[27, 32]]	[]	['ALCAM']	[]	PMC1626102.nxml

12201	For the series of 99 clinical isolates, HA titers were compared with prevalence of sLex binding.	[[83, 87]]	[]	['sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12202	This was assessed by the use of 125I-labeled sialyl-dimeric Lex (sdiLex) antigen conjugate.	[[65, 71]]	[]	['sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12203	The sdiLex antigen consists of two repetitive and fucosylated Lex antigens terminally substituted with α2–3–linked sialic acid (Table 1).	[[4, 10]]	[]	['sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12204	A total of 37 of 99 isolates (37%) could bind to sdiLex, and 22 of 37 (60%) of these isolates proficient in sdiLex binding also demonstrated reduction in sialyl-dependent binding (sia-HA properties).	[[49, 55], [108, 114], [180, 186]]	[]	['sdiLex', 'sdiLex', 'sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12205	In comparison, among the 62 isolates that did not bind sdiLex, only five isolates (8%) demonstrated sia-HA properties.	[[55, 61], [100, 106]]	[]	['sdiLex', 'sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12206	In the group of 31 isolates that instead increased their HA titers due to sialidase treatment, only one single isolate showed distinct sdiLex binding, two isolates bound weakly, and the great majority (28 isolates) completely lacked sdiLex-binding properties (Figure 2A)..	[[135, 141], [233, 239]]	[]	['sdiLex', 'sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12207	A strong correlation was found between bacterial binding to sdiLex and HA titers resulting from sialidase treatment (correlation of rank = 0.547; p < 0.001) (Figure 2A).	[[60, 66]]	[]	['sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12208	Strain J99 has previously been shown to express the SabA adhesin and to bind sialylated Lewis glycans such as sdiLex, sLex, and sLea (Table 1).	[[52, 56], [110, 116], [118, 122]]	[]	['SabA', 'sdiLex', 'sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12209	Here, the J99 and J99sabA strains were compared for sia-HA properties.	[[52, 58]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12210	The results showed that while strain J99 was positive for sia-HA, the J99sabA mutant is fully devoid of all sia-HA properties (Table 2, 16× [a] versus 0 [b]).	[[58, 64], [108, 114]]	[]	['sia-HA', 'sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12211	This result is most consistent with SabA being the sialyl-dependent hemagglutinin of H.	[[36, 40]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12212	In comparison, the J99 babA deletion mutant (J99babA) was not affected in sia-HA, but instead behaved most similarly to the J99 parent strain (Table 2, 16x [c] versus [a]).	[[74, 80]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12213	Taken together, the results also demonstrate that binding by BabA to fucosylated blood group antigens does not confer erythrocyte aggregation and HA..	[[61, 65]]	[]	['BabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12214	Binding of solubilized SabA protein was analyzed by affinity adsorption to sialylated erythrocyte surfaces.	[[23, 27]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12215	Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against SabA showed that SabA was affinity absorbed onto intact and sialylated erythrocytes, whereas no SabA bound to sialidase-treated and sialic acid–depleted erythrocytes (Figure 2B)..	[[44, 48], [61, 65], [140, 144]]	[]	['SabA', 'SabA', 'SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12216	Proteolytic removal of cell-surface glycoproteins resulted in a distinct increase in sia-HA for both the J99 wt strain and the J99 babA mutant (Table 2, [d] and [e]).	[[85, 91]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12217	coli, which is known to hemagglutinate by binding to the sialylated erythrocyte glycoprotein glycophorin A (Table 2, [1]) [22], was most sensitive to protease treatment of erythrocytes, which even at low concentrations completely abrogated sia-HA (Table 2, [f] versus [g]).	[[240, 246]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12218	In addition, sialidase treatment and removal of the charged sialic acid residues could confer better exposure of the Galα4Gal receptor epitopes in glycan core chains and increased sia-HA (Table 2, [j] and [k] versus [h]).	[[180, 186]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12219	Taken together, the results show that the main part of sia-HA is conferred by sialyl-dependent binding of SabA to the tight membrane–associated and sialylated glycosphingolipids (i.e., gangliosides)..	[[106, 110], [55, 61]]	[]	['SabA', 'sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12220	Interestingly, NeuAcα2–8 modifications to the NeuAcα2–6–substituted GD3 and DPG glycans seemingly interfered with SabA-mediated binding.	[[114, 118]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12221	Similarly, the GD1a glycan, which is similar to the NeuAcα2–3-neolactotetraosylceramide (NeuAcα3SPG), but with an additional NeuAcα2–3 residue linked to the core, had lost its binding epitope for SabA (Table 3), which further points to the importance of the steric presentation of the NeuAcα2–3Gal epitope for the SabA-mediated binding mode.	[[196, 200], [314, 318]]	[]	['SabA', 'SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12222	The absolute requirement for SabA was demonstrated by the sabA deletion mutant strain J99sabA, which did not bind to any of the gangliosides tested (Figure 2Ciii), although there was consistent SabA-independent binding to the reference non-acid gangliotriaosylceramide (lane 8; [36])..	[[29, 33], [194, 198]]	[]	['SabA', 'SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12223	The sialylated receptor epitope for SabA was further characterized by use of structurally defined sialylated glycoconjugates of various complexities in terms of fucosylation and core chain and spacer unit lengths (Figure 3).	[[36, 40]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12224	The extended sdiLex antigen was recently shown to be the best receptor for SabA, which further suggests that fucosylation, sialylation, and length of the core chain are parameters that together form a high-affinity binding epitope for SabA.	[[75, 79], [13, 19]]	[]	['SabA', 'sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12225	The results suggest that presentation of the sialic acid residue by the α2–3 linkage is essential for SabA-mediated binding both to soluble glycoconjugates and for binding to gangliosides in solid phase.	[[102, 106]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12226	Since binding by SabA to sialyl-lactose was rather weak for all strains, the influence of chain length and steric flexibility in promotion of binding was investigated by use of sialyl-lactosamine (sLn; NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAc) attached to albumin, by either the short three-atom [sLn(3)] or the extended 14-atom [sLn(14)] spacer molecules.	[[17, 21], [197, 200]]	[[177, 195]]	['SabA', 'sLn']	['sialyl-lactosamine']	PMC1626103.nxml

12230	Strains J99, SMI65, and SMI27 demonstrated similar profiles in binding affinities for the series of sdiLex, sLex, sLea, and sLn(14) in the range of 9.6 × 108  M−1 to 6.4 × 109 M−1.	[[100, 106], [108, 112]]	[]	['sdiLex', 'sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12231	The stronger binding affinity reported relates to the improved bovine serum albumin (BSA) preparation used here as blocking agent, because we found BSA to contain sialyl-competitive constituents (unpublished data).	[[85, 88], [148, 151]]	[[63, 83]]	['BSA', 'BSA']	['bovine serum albumin']	PMC1626103.nxml
12232	Interestingly, binding to nonsialylated glycans such as Leb was not affected by the improved BSA preparation, which might be due to lack of the human/primate-specific antigen, Leb, in bovine serum constituents.	[[93, 96], [56, 59], [176, 179]]	[]	['BSA', 'Leb', 'Leb']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12242	The results showed that the series of sabA deletion mutants could no longer bind to sialylated antigens, which suggests that SabA is the main factor responsible for polymorphism in binding to sialylated antigens (Figure 6).	[[125, 129]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12243	To thoroughly investigate if the local environment, such as the outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide composition of the individual strain, could influence sialyl-dependent binding properties of SabA, a complementation test was performed.	[[195, 199]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12248	Interestingly, the SMI9sabAJ99 complementation mutant demonstrated a sLea/sdiLex binding affinity ratio of 0.93 (i.e., SabAJ99 expressed in the background strain SMI9 is most similar in affinity to that of the donor strain J99) (Figure 7).	[[74, 80]]	[]	['sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12249	The sdiLex-binding capacity, which reflects the number of functional SabA adhesins on the bacterial surface, remained the same (1.2 nM) in strain SMI9 after introduction of the sabAJ99 gene.	[[69, 73], [4, 10]]	[]	['SabA', 'sdiLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12256	Mechanisms of rapid adaptation to local inflammation responses may be conferred by rapid on/off phase variation in SabA expression [15] and recombination events involving babA and babB [38,39]..	[[115, 119]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12259	Although the erythrocyte-binding sia-HA phenotype is prevalent among clinical isolates, it has not yet been recognized as a virulence property of H.	[[33, 39]]	[]	['sia-HA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12261	pylori exhibits on/off phase variation in sialyl binding, and sia-HA could be rapidly lost during passage in culture [15]; (2) almost half of the strains that bound sLex did not cause sia-HA (Figure 2), which suggests that many strains require complex sialylated glycans for binding (such structures are limited on erythrocytes, but are present both in gastric epithelium and on neutrophils [45]); and (3) culture conditions have been shown to influence binding specificity and affinity for sialylated glycoconjugates [34].	[[62, 68], [184, 190], [165, 169]]	[]	['sia-HA', 'sia-HA', 'sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12262	The HA properties were found to be highly correlated with sLex binding activity, which implicates SabA as the causative agent in sia-HA.	[[98, 102], [58, 62]]	[]	['SabA', 'sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12263	Thus, by the use of deletion mutants, we were able to unambiguously identify SabA as the H.	[[77, 81]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12264	To further our understanding of SabA binding, H.	[[32, 36]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12265	The results suggest that the NeuAcα2–3Gal disaccharide constitutes the minimal binding epitope for SabA binding, which is in agreement with previous reports on the binding specificity for the H.	[[99, 103]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12266	However, the core chain length was shown to affect SabA-mediated binding to erythrocyte gangliosides, where the NeuAcα2–3-neolactooctaocylceramide bound much better than the shorter NeuAcα2–3-neolactotetraocylceramide.	[[51, 55]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12267	Furthermore, all strains demonstrated increased binding for sLex, sdiLex, and sLea compared to sialylated structures lacking fucose constituents.	[[66, 72], [60, 64]]	[]	['sdiLex', 'sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12268	These results are in keeping with our previous results on high-affinity binding of SabA to extended gangliosides with repetitive Lex motifs [15].	[[83, 87]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12269	Nevertheless, the sialylated protein (albumin) conjugates used in this study are also efficient receptors for SabA-mediated H.	[[110, 114]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12270	Thus, strong and multivalent (“Velcro”-type) binding to sialylated epitopes on glycosphingolipids (gangliosides) with extended core chains would promote membrane-tight binding of SabA during experimental HA and in the inflamed gastric epithelium..	[[179, 183]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml

12272	This is a distinct difference compared to previous results, where merely half of sLex-binding strains also bound sLea [15].	[[81, 85]]	[]	['sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12273	This is also supported by the 10-fold increased binding affinity for sLex, 1 × 109 M−1, revealed by strain 17875babA1A2 (Figure 4).	[[69, 73]]	[]	['sLex']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12274	In contrast to pilus-associated adhesins, SabA exhibits a C-terminal putative ß-barrel domain, and hence is most likely instead a membrane-integrated protein.	[[42, 46]]	[]	['SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12275	Our studies point to the fact that the detailed binding properties of SabA described here, similar to BabA [14], are inherent features of the adhesin proteins themselves..	[[102, 106], [70, 74]]	[]	['BabA', 'SabA']	[]	PMC1626103.nxml
12276	The polymorphic binding to sialylated conjugates probably relates to small differences in SabA, which is similar to BabA in that positive selection for nonsynonymous codon substitutions have generated variant BabA adhesins that demonstrate specialist and generalist binding modes for ABO blood group antigens [14].

12341	The lack of active effector caspase-3 in infected cells indicated that Ctr infection may prevent caspase activation by IAPs, which inhibit caspases by direct binding and/or the induction of their proteasomal degradation [13].	[[71, 74], [119, 122]]	[]	['Ctr', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12342	To test whether chlamydial infection may cause increased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was established for mRNA quantification of the IAPs.	[[180, 183], [124, 131]]	[]	['IAP', 'qRT-PCR']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12343	mRNAs of neither cIAP-1 and XIAP nor survivin were significantly increased in cells infected with Ctr at 24 h postinfection (Figure 2A).	[[17, 21], [98, 101], [29, 32], [28, 32]]	[]	['cIAP', 'Ctr', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12344	Only the mRNA level of cIAP-2 was increased 6- to 8-fold (Figure 2A).	[[23, 27]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12345	The expression of IAPs was also monitored by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2B).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12346	The levels of cIAP-2 and, unexpectedly, that of survivin were clearly increased in infected cells (Figure 2B).	[[14, 18]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12347	Moreover, time-course experiments over 48 h revealed a steady increase in cIAP-2 and survivin protein levels in infected cells (Figure 2C).	[[74, 78]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12348	These data suggested that IAP expression is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in infected cells..	[[26, 29]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12349	To test if IAPs are required for the inhibition of apoptosis in infected HeLa cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed to specifically interfere with IAP expression.	[[11, 14], [162, 165], [109, 114]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12350	Silencing of the cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP, and survivin genes was tested by qRT-PCR (Figure S2A) and immunoblotting (Figure S2B).	[[17, 21], [25, 29], [34, 37], [72, 79], [33, 37]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'qRT-PCR', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12351	Functional siRNAs were then transfected, and infected and treated cells were analyzed.	[[11, 16]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12352	Interestingly, interfering with cIAP-2 expression sensitized infected cells to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis (Figure 3) as revealed by TUNEL analysis.	[[83, 86], [32, 36]]	[]	['CHX', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12353	We therefore analyzed whether suppression of cIAP-2 expression influenced the activation of effector caspases.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12354	The generation of the caspase-3 p17 fragment was reduced by 57.8% in infected treated cells compared to treated cells as was analyzed by densitometry (Figure 3B) suggesting that the processing of the caspase-3 p19 fragment to the p17 fragment is controlled by cIAP-2.	[[260, 264]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12355	This assumption is in agreement with only 28.8% reduction of the p17 fragment in infected treated cells versus treated cells in which cIAP-2 expression was reduced by siRNA transfection to the level of noninfected cells (Figure 3B), demonstrating a 50.17% rescue of p19 to p17 processing by cIAP-2 silencing..

12356	When the expression of cIAP-1 and XIAP was suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi), the infected cells were sensitized to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis despite the up-regulation of cIAP-2 (Figure 3C).

12357	To confirm these unexpected results, the same experiment was repeated with a second set of siRNAs to rule out unspecific off-target effects of the first set of siRNAs (Figure 3C).	[[91, 96], [160, 165]]	[]	['siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12358	It is important to note that irrespective of the cell type and multiplicity of infection (MOI) used, sensitization depended on the size of the inclusions.	[[90, 93]]	[[63, 88]]	['MOI']	['multiplicity of infection']	PMC1626104.nxml
12359	Sensitization did not correlate with the infection-induced changes in the expression levels of IAPs since the transfection of siRNA directed against survivin completely prevented the strong up-regulation but had no sensitizing effect on TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis (Figure 3C).	[[241, 244], [95, 98], [126, 131]]	[]	['CHX', 'IAP', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml

12361	A possible explanation for the sensitization of infected cells to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis by silencing of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, or XIAP was that all IAPs whose ablation sensitized infected cells are organized in functional complexes.	[[70, 73], [108, 112], [116, 120], [128, 131], [145, 148], [127, 131]]	[]	['CHX', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12362	Therefore, we attempted to isolate endogenous IAP complexes from control and apoptotic cells.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12363	When we precipitated cIAP-2, XIAP was coprecipitated and vice versa (Figure 4A), suggesting the interaction of cIAP-2 and XIAP in a complex in these cells.	[[21, 25], [111, 115], [30, 33], [123, 126], [29, 33], [122, 126]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12364	The amount of these IAPs was reduced in apoptotic cells probably due to cleavage or degradation during apoptosis (Figure 4A).	[[20, 23]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12365	Since silencing of cIAP-1 also sensitized infected cells to apoptosis, we investigated whether cIAP-1 was present in the cIAP-2–XIAP complex.	[[19, 23], [95, 99], [121, 125], [129, 132], [128, 132]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12366	cIAP-1 was detected in the cIAP-2–XIAP precipitates by immunoblot analysis (unpublished data) and immunoprecipitates of cIAP-1 contained cIAP-2 and XIAP (Figure S3), confirming cIAP-1 as part of the cIAP-2–XIAP complex.	[[27, 31], [120, 124], [137, 141], [177, 181], [199, 203], [35, 38], [149, 152], [207, 210], [34, 38], [148, 152], [206, 210]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12367	Consistent with our sensitization data, we could not detect survivin in the cIAP-2 and XIAP immunoprecipitates (Figure S3B).	[[76, 80], [88, 91], [87, 91]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12368	These data also suggested that the antibodies we used to immunoprecipitate IAPs did not exhibit cross-reactivity with all BIR domain–containing proteins.	[[122, 125], [75, 78]]	[]	['BIR', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12369	Active caspase-3 was detected in all IAP complexes precipitated from apoptotic cells, indicating a role of these IAPs in the activation of caspase-3 (Figure 4B).	[[37, 40], [113, 116]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12370	These data suggested that the “sensitizing” IAPs interact with each other either directly or indirectly in a single or multiple complexes to modulate cell survival.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12371	Interestingly, increasing amounts of XIAP coprecipitated with endogenous cIAP-2 from infected cells compared to noninfected cells (Figure 4C).	[[73, 77], [38, 41], [37, 41]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12372	Since XIAP is not up-regulated in infected cells (Figure 2A and 2B), coprecipitation of XIAP and cIAP-2 indicated that both were recruited to the same complex.	[[97, 101], [7, 10], [89, 92], [6, 10], [88, 92]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12373	Thus, the infection-induced increase in cIAP-2 levels may initiate the recruitment of the strong caspases inhibitor XIAP to a complex regulating caspase-3 activity..	[[40, 44], [117, 120], [116, 120]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12374	To prove the existence of native IAP-IAP complexes, we isolated the cytosol of HeLa cells by subcellular fractionation and separated the proteins by gel filtration.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12375	cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP were found together in fractions containing protein complexes of around 400 kDa, and the fractions representing the monomeric forms (Figure 4D).	[[8, 12], [21, 24], [20, 24]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12376	While low amounts of cIAP-2, XIAP, and cIAP-1 were also present in several of the high-molecular-weight fractions, survivin was mainly detected in the low-molecular-weight fraction reflecting the monomeric size (Figure 4D).	[[21, 25], [39, 43], [30, 33], [29, 33]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12377	Similar high-molecular-weight IAP-IAP complexes could also be detected in the cytosol of HecIB cells and Jurkat T cells (Figures S4 and S5A).	[[30, 33]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12378	To check if the 400-kDa complex is disrupted during apoptosis, gel filtration experiments were performed with HeLa and Jurkat cells induced to apoptosis with TNF/CHX and anti-CD95 antibody, respectively (Figures 4E and S5B).	[[162, 165]]	[]	['CHX']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12379	Consistent with our previous observations (Figures 4A and S3), only low amounts of IAPs were detected in the fractions from apoptotic cells, suggesting that IAPs are possibly cleaved or degraded during cell death (Figures 4E and S5B).	[[83, 86], [157, 160]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12380	However, we have also detected a small amount of cIAP-1 in a high-molecular-weight fraction of around 850 kDa in HeLa cell fractions, suggesting that cIAP-1 is possibly recruited to a different complex during apoptosis.	[[49, 53], [150, 154]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12381	It was already known that Smac binds to IAPs and inactivates them during apoptosis.	[[40, 43]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12382	To investigate if the interaction of Smac with the IAP-IAP complex occurs during apoptosis, we probed the same blots for Smac.	[[51, 54]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12383	Interestingly, Smac was detected in all the IAP-containing fractions of high but not of low molecular weight (Figures 4E and S5B), suggesting an interaction and a possible inactivation of these IAP complexes by Smac during apoptosis.	[[44, 47], [194, 197]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12384	Consistent with a role of the heteromeric IAP complex for the activation of caspases, caspase-3 copurified with the Smac-enriched fractions in apoptotic cells (Figures 4E and S5B).	[[42, 45]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12385	This, and the exclusive presence of Smac and active caspase-3 in the high-molecular-weight fractions, may suggest that a heteromer rather than a monomer is probably the functional IAP unit.	[[180, 183]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12386	Taken together, these data confirmed that “sensitizing” IAPs are organized in heteromeric complexes..	[[56, 59]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12387	In addition to transcriptional regulation, IAP stability is posttranslationally controlled by phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation [13,26].	[[43, 46]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12388	As we have detected IAP-IAP complexes at endogenous levels in these cells, we tested if loss of individual IAPs influences the stability of other IAPs.	[[20, 23], [107, 110], [146, 149]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12389	siRNAs were transfected in HeLa cells and the amount of IAPs was measured by immunoblot analysis.	[[56, 59]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12390	The specificity of the different siRNAs, e.g., the lack of any cross-inhibition on other IAPs, was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure S6).	[[89, 92], [112, 119], [33, 38]]	[]	['IAP', 'qRT-PCR', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12391	Surprisingly, silencing of XIAP expression had a pronounced effect on the amount of up-regulated cIAP-2 and survivin in infected cells (Figure 5).	[[97, 101], [28, 31], [27, 31]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12392	Down-regulation of cIAP-2 led to a mild reduction of cIAP-1 and survivin but had no influence on XIAP levels.	[[19, 23], [53, 57], [98, 101], [97, 101]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12393	However, suppression of cIAP-1 expression had no negative effect on cIAP-2 or XIAP, and repression of survivin by RNAi did not alter cIAP-1, cIAP-2, or XIAP levels (Figure 5), suggesting that some of the “sensitizing” IAPs exert a stabilizing activity on other IAPs.	[[24, 28], [68, 72], [133, 137], [141, 145], [79, 82], [153, 156], [218, 221], [261, 264], [114, 118], [78, 82], [152, 156]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'RNAi', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12394	All these data suggested that IAPs can influence the stability of each other..	[[30, 33]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12395	Among the “sensitizing” IAPs, the most evident observation was the regulation of IAP-2 stability by XIAP.	[[24, 27], [81, 84]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12396	To understand the possible mechanisms, we have established the permanent silencing of XIAP by lentiviral transfer of shRNA (shXIAP) into HeLa cells.	[[87, 90], [127, 130], [86, 90]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12397	Chlamydial infection induced the up-regulation of cIAP-2 mRNA levels in vector control and shXIAP-transduced cells (unpublished data).	[[50, 54], [94, 97]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12398	To check if the loss of XIAP disrupts the formation of the IAP-IAP complex, we performed gel filtration experiments with the cytosol of XIAP-silenced cells.	[[25, 28], [59, 62], [137, 140], [24, 28], [136, 140]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12399	Immnunoblot analysis revealed that cIAP-1 and most of the cIAP-2 were no longer detected in the 400-kDa fractions of XIAP-silenced cells (Figure 4).	[[35, 39], [58, 62], [118, 121], [117, 121]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12400	In addition, a portion of cIAP-2 was consistently present in the high-molecular-weight fraction of around 1 to 1.5 MDa, suggesting that cIAP-2 is recruited to a different complex in the absence of XIAP (Figure 4).

12401	As cIAP-2 has an inherent destructive capability by autoubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation [27], we checked if the loss of the infection-induced up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 can be rescued by pretreatment of these cells with proteasome inhibitors.	[[3, 7], [186, 190]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12402	As expected, infection of the control (empty vector-carrying) cells leads to an increase in cIAP-2 protein levels.	[[92, 96]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12403	Consistent with the previous observations, we could not detect the up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 in the infected cells expressing shXIAP (Figure S7A).	[[92, 96], [135, 138]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12404	When the cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors, the up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 was indeed rescued in the infected XIAP-silenced cells (Figure S7A).	[[85, 89], [128, 131], [127, 131]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12405	Since proteins are degraded not only in the proteasomes but also in the lysosomes [28], we checked if the turnover of cIAP-2 protein levels in these cells is also influenced by the degradation by lysosomes.	[[118, 122]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12406	Surprisingly, pretreatment of cells with the lysosomal H+-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin also inhibited the degradation of cIAP-2 in the control and XIAP-silenced cells in a similar fashion (Figure S7A), suggesting that the degradation of cIAP-2 in these cells is mediated by both proteasomes and lysosmes.

12407	To investigate whether cIAP-2 overexpressed by transfection of a eukaryotic expression vector behaves similarly to cIAP-2 up-regulated during infection, cIAP-2 was transfected into XIAP-silenced cells and treated with proteasome and lysosome inhibitors.

12408	The inhibitors failed to prominently increase the amounts of cIAP-2 in transfected control and XIAP-silenced cells (Figure S7B).	[[61, 65], [96, 99], [95, 99]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12409	Interestingly, cIAP-2 transfected control cells contained reduced amounts of XIAP, which was partially rescued by proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Figure S7B).	[[15, 19], [78, 81], [77, 81]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12410	These data showed that, different than in infection-induced up-regulation, overexpression of transfected cIAP-2 could not be rescued by either proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors but rather caused the proteasomal degradation of endogenous XIAP..

12414	A possible explanation for the marked apoptosis resistance observed in infected cells was therefore the infection-induced up-regulation of cIAP-2 specifically blocking the activation of effector caspase-3.	[[139, 143]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12415	Although cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 are also part of the TNF-receptor complex potentially modulating the activity of caspase-8 [29,30], a direct inhibition of caspase-8 activity by IAPs has not been demonstrated yet.

12416	The caspase-8 substrate BID was, however, cleaved as efficiently as in noninfected cells, suggesting the effector caspases as major targets for apoptosis inhibition by IAPs.	[[168, 171]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml

12418	Since XIAP has been found to tether mature caspase-3 to the apoptosome and release of caspase-3 required the XIAP-antagonizing protein Smac [31], the IAP complex formed in cells infected with Ctr may thus favor the association of IAPs and recruitment of caspase-3 in a way refractory to activation.

12419	Consistent with this, neither cytochrome c nor Smac is released from the mitochondria of infected cells (unpublished data), although BID is similarly processed in the infected and control cells treated with TNF/CHX, suggesting that chlamydial infection employs multiple strategies to resist host cell apoptosis..

12421	It was shown that cIAP-1−/− cells have increased levels of cIAP-2 protein consistent with the down-regulation of cIAP-2 by cIAP-1 [32].	[[18, 22], [59, 63], [113, 117], [123, 127]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml

12423	In addition, it was shown that in response to cell death stimuli, survivin associated with XIAP via the BIR domain to promote the stability of XIAP [34].	[[104, 107], [92, 95], [144, 147], [91, 95], [143, 147]]	[]	['BIR', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12424	Apoptosis resistance of infected cells required cIAP-2 up-regulation but also XIAP and cIAP-1, as depletion of the latter two sensitizes the cells to apoptosis despite cIAP-2 up-regulation.	[[48, 52], [87, 91], [168, 172], [79, 82], [78, 82]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12425	The most likely explanation was therefore that all these IAPs are organized in a functional complex.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12426	We could indeed confirm the direct association of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP in these cells by immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments, suggesting that they function in unison to modulate the activation of caspases in vivo.	[[50, 54], [58, 62], [71, 74], [70, 74]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12427	We found no effect of survivin on apoptosis of infected cells, although survivin-depleted cells underwent mitotic catastrophe and formed giant cells (unpublished data) as previously described [35], suggesting that the depletion by RNAi was effective.	[[231, 235]]	[]	['RNAi']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12428	By applying gel filtration assays,we could demonstrate the existence of a high-molecular-weight heteromeric complex in the range of 400 kDa containing cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP.	[[151, 155], [159, 163]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12429	However, we have also detected IAPs in other high-molecular-fractions, suggesting the existence of several IAP-containing complexes.	[[31, 34], [107, 110]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12430	In support of our sensitization data, we could not detect survivin in the IAP-containing high-molecular-weight fractions..	[[74, 77]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12431	Since depletion of XIAP by siRNAs affected the stability of cIAP-2 (Figure 5A), we asked whether loss of XIAP led to disintegration of IAP complexes.	[[60, 64], [20, 23], [106, 109], [135, 138], [27, 32], [19, 23], [105, 109]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'siRNA', 'XIAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12432	Gel filtration experiments with XIAP-silenced cells revealed that this is indeed the case as cIAP-1 was detected only in the monomeric fractions.	[[93, 97], [33, 36], [32, 36]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12433	However, apart from the monomeric fractions and trace amounts in the 400-kDa fractions, a significant portion of cIAP-2 was also found in a high-molecular-weight fraction of around 1 MDa, which may reflect the recruitment to a different complex possibly involved in the fate of cIAP-2 under these conditions.	[[113, 117], [278, 282]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12434	These results are in contrast to what was reported from XIAP knockout MEFs which contained larger amounts of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 than wild-type MEFs [36].	[[109, 113], [120, 124], [57, 60], [56, 60]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12435	If IAPs are organized into stable complexes, what is their role during apoptosis? Several studies have demonstrated that all the IAPs can bind to caspases directly to inhibit cell death.	[[3, 6], [129, 132]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12436	However, we found a direct role only for cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP in maintaining apoptosis resistance under these conditions.	[[41, 45], [49, 53], [62, 65], [61, 65]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12437	Silencing any one of the IAPs removes the blockade in the processing of caspase-3 to the active p17 fragment in response to TNF/CHX in infected cells (Figure 3B and unpublished data).	[[128, 131], [25, 28]]	[]	['CHX', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12438	Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that a heteromeric IAP-IAP complex is more potent to block caspases than individual IAPs in vivo..	[[58, 61], [123, 126]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12439	As we have detected IAPs in heteromeric complexes, we addressed the question if Smac directly associates with these complexes during apoptosis.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12440	Interestingly, gel filtration experiments with apoptotic cells revealed the presence of Smac and active caspase-3 in all the IAP-containing high-molecular-weight fractions, irrespective of the apoptosis inducer, suggesting that Smac indeed binds and inactivates IAP-IAP complexes in vivo to induce effector caspase activation and cell death..	[[125, 128], [262, 265]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12441	Here we revealed that cIAP-2 levels in the infected cells are regulated by both lysosomes and proteasomes.	[[22, 26]]	[]	['cIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12442	Treatment of the cells with proteasome and, surprisingly, with lysosomal inhibitors could rescue cIAP-2 in control and XIAP-silenced cells suggesting different ubiquitin modifications in cIAP-2.	[[97, 101], [187, 191], [120, 123], [119, 123]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12443	However, when we overexpressed cIAP-2 by transfection of expression constructs, we could not rescue XIAP, in the presence of neither MG132 nor Bafilomycin (Figure S7B).	[[31, 35], [101, 104], [100, 104]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12444	(2005), overexpression of cIAP-2 by transfection caused the degradation of endogenous XIAP (Figure S7B).	[[26, 30], [87, 90], [86, 90]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12445	Because we did not observe degradation of XIAP in infected cells with high cIAP-2 levels, it suggests that Chlamydia infection interferes with this process, or that NF-κB targets other factors, which influence relative stabilities of IAPs.	[[75, 79], [43, 46], [234, 237], [165, 170], [42, 46]]	[]	['cIAP', 'IAP', 'IAP', 'NF-κB', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12446	Loss of cIAP-1 has also been described to result in the increase of cIAP-2 but not XIAP [32].	[[8, 12], [68, 72], [84, 87], [83, 87]]	[]	['cIAP', 'cIAP', 'IAP', 'XIAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12447	While we did not observe these effects in our siRNA experiments, it appears that a general theme of posttranscriptional regulation by IAPs among themselves is emerging..	[[134, 137], [46, 51]]	[]	['IAP', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12448	We are currently investigating the effect of overexpressed IAPs on the native IAP complexes demonstrated here.	[[59, 62], [78, 81]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12449	Taken together, our data of a constitutive “IAPosome,” where IAPs positively affect the stability of other IAPs important for their apoptosis-inhibiting activity, are a new aspect of how these proteins function.	[[61, 64], [107, 110]]	[]	['IAP', 'IAP']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml
12450	Moreover, cIAP-2 is not only involved in antiapoptosis induced by Ctr in epithelial cells but is also up-regulated in monocytes infected with C.	[[10, 14], [66, 69]]	[]	['cIAP', 'Ctr']	[]	PMC1626104.nxml

12534	The mechanism that involves binding to and targeting VHL and p53 for degradation is mediated by an unconventional intrinsic ubiquitin E3 ligase activity encoded by the SOCS-box–like motif of LANA.	[[168, 172], [53, 56]]	[]	['SOCS', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12535	These results imply that this ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates normal VHL and p53 turnover and show that their destabilizations are greatly enhanced by interaction with LANA.	[[76, 79]]	[]	['VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12536	This can contribute to a disruption of the induced antiviral state during the KSHV latent infection..	[[78, 82]]	[]	['KSHV']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml

12538	Since Elongin C has been shown to directly bind to BC-box containing proteins which usually interact with Elongin B and C complex (Elongin BC), the association of LANA with Elongin C in yeast is likely to also involve Elongin B.	[[131, 141], [163, 167]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12539	To confirm the binding results from the yeast two-hybrid screen, we examined in vitro binding assays of Elongin BC to LANA.	[[104, 114]]	[]	['Elongin BC']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12540	In in vitro translated [35S]-labeled methionine, different truncated forms (N: 1–340 amino acids [aa], C: 762-1162 aa, and NC: 1–327̂929-1162 aa) of LANA with myc tag were incubated with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Elongin B (Elo.

12541	As shown in Figure 1A, LANA did not bind Elongin B, whereas it clearly bound to Elongin C.	[[23, 27]]	[]	['LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12542	Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of LANA predominantly interacted with Elongin C.	[[39, 43]]	[]	['LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12543	This was further confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation (IP) using a myc-tagged LANA N truncated polypeptide (Figure 1B, lanes 5 and 6).	[[59, 61], [82, 86]]	[[38, 57]]	['IP', 'LANA']	['immunoprecipitation']	PMC1626105.nxml
12544	In further experiments, association between LANA and the Elongin BC complex was assessed in co-IP experiments.	[[57, 67], [95, 97], [44, 48]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'IP', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12545	Interestingly, Elongin B efficiently precipitated with the amino-terminal domain of LANA only when incubated along with Elongin C (Figure 1B, compare lanes 6 and 7)..	[[84, 88]]	[]	['LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12546	To specifically address the question as to whether or not LANA does associate with the Elongin BC complex in KSHV-infected cells, co-IP assays were done in PEL cells positive for KSHV as well as an isogenic set of BJAB cell lines with and without KSHV infection.	[[87, 97], [133, 135], [109, 113], [179, 183], [247, 251], [58, 62], [156, 159]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'IP', 'KSHV', 'KSHV', 'KSHV', 'LANA', 'PEL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12547	The results of this assay nicely showed that LANA associates with Elongin B as well as Elongin C in the PEL cell line BCBL-1 as well as in a KSHV-infected BJAB cell line (Figure 1C).	[[141, 145], [45, 49], [104, 107]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA', 'PEL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12548	This suggests that LANA does exist in complex with Elongin BC in KSHV-positive cells..	[[51, 61], [65, 69], [19, 23]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'KSHV', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml

12550	To determine whether the Elongin BC complex could function as an adaptor which links LANA to a Cullin/Rbx1 module, thus reconstituting an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, IP assays against myc tag were performed on lysates of Saos-2 cells cotransfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-Rbx1 and HA-Cullin (Cul2 or Cul5) in the presence or absence of myc-tagged LANA expression vectors (Figure 2A).

12553	Further experiments with or without Elongin BC coexpression demonstrated that LANA–Elongin BC complex did assemble with the Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex containing LANA, Elongin BC, Rbx1, and Cul5 (Figure 2B) and the Elongin BC complex can increase the affinity of LANA interaction with Cul5 and Rbx1 module (Figure 2B)..

12554	A well-known family of Elongin BC–interacting proteins, including VHL tumor suppressor and SOCS proteins, has been recently identified as SOCS-box proteins [30].	[[91, 95], [138, 142], [66, 69]]	[]	['SOCS', 'SOCS', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12555	These proteins directly interact with Elongin BC through their conserved BC-box motif [(A/P/S/T)L-x3-C-x3-(A/I/L/V)] and associate with Cullin proteins through the conserved Cul-box motif [ΦxxLPxP] [30].	[[38, 48], [174, 177]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'Cul']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12556	Moreover, the two Cul boxes, the Cul2 box and the Cul5 box, are specific for distinguishing binding with the different Cullin proteins (Cul2 or Cul5).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['Cul']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12557	To determine whether LANA interacts with Elongin BC and the Cullin protein through its SOCS-box motif, we first aligned the sequence of LANA with VHL and SOCS (1, 2, and 3) proteins.	[[41, 51], [21, 25], [136, 140], [87, 91], [154, 158], [146, 149]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'SOCS', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12558	Our analysis showed that LANA probably also contains an SOCS-box–like motif based on the hydrophobic homology of consensus sequences.	[[25, 29], [56, 60]]	[]	['LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12559	However, the BC box and Cul box in this viral SOCS-box motif are atypical as distinguished from the BC box which is usually close to the Cul box found in SOCS-box motifs of cellular proteins.	[[24, 27], [137, 140], [46, 50], [154, 158]]	[]	['Cul', 'Cul', 'SOCS', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12560	In KSHV LANA these motifs were separately located from each other in the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal domains.	[[3, 7], [8, 12]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12561	Furthermore, in contrast to the VHL Cul2 box and SOCS protein Cul5 box, the LANA Cul box was significantly similar to the Cul box of the SOCS protein family.	[[81, 84], [122, 125], [76, 80], [49, 53], [137, 141], [32, 35]]	[]	['Cul', 'Cul', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'SOCS', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12562	This supports the evidence of LANA associated with Cul5, not Cul2, protein in the IP assay above.	[[82, 84], [30, 34]]	[]	['IP', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12563	Additionally, the ORF73 homolog of LANA encoded by other gammaherpesvirus, including the rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) or herpesvirus saimiri (HVS A11 and C488), also contains a similar SOCS-box–like motif (Figure 3A)..	[[35, 39], [189, 193]]	[]	['LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12564	To confirm that LANA associates with Elongin BC and Cullin 5 protein through its BC-box and Cul box motif, the corresponding site-specific mutation and deletion of the LANA SOCS-box–like motifs were generated.

12565	Co-IP assays using different LANA mutants showed that the BC-box motif deletion mutant resulted in a failure of LANA to bind with the Elongin BC complex (Figure 3B).	[[134, 144], [3, 5], [29, 33], [112, 116]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'IP', 'LANA', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12566	Additionally, LANA mutants with specific site mutations in the BC-box motif also resulted in a decrease in the ability of LANA to bind to the Elongin BC complex when compared with wild-type (WT) LANA (Figure 3B).	[[142, 152], [14, 18], [122, 126], [195, 199], [191, 193]]	[[180, 189]]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'WT']	['wild-type']	PMC1626105.nxml
12567	LANA binding with Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex was completely disrupted when the SOCS-box motif was deleted (Figure 3C).	[[39, 49], [92, 96]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml

12569	Thus, when the LANA Cul-box motif deletion mutant was coexpressed with Elongin BC and tested for binding to the Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex, we observed that the LANA mutants with Cul5 box deletion had same remaining binding activity to the Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex (Figure 3C).

12570	To confirm Cul-box motif is necessary for LANA to specifically bind Cul5 protein, further experiments were performed and demonstrated that LANA with the Cul-box deleted lost binding to the Cul5 protein when assayed without the Elongin BC complex coexpression (unpublished data).

12571	Taken together, these data suggest that these motifs are critical for LANA interaction with the Elongin BC/Cul5/Rbx1 module and indicate that BC-box motif and Cul-box motif are likely to be in close proximity in terms of the spatial structure of the LANA protein in order to constitute an intact SOCS-box motif..

12572	To investigate whether the LANA–Elongin BC–Cul5–Rbx1 complex possesses ubiquitin ligase activity, the complex was immunoaffinity purified and assayed for its ability to activate formation of polyubiquitin chains by the E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme Ubc5a in the presence of ATP, the E1 ubiquitin–activating enzyme Uba1, and GST-ubiquitin.	[[326, 329]]	[]	['GST']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12573	As shown in Figure 3D, the LANA–Elongin BC–Cul5–Rbx1 complex stimulated formation of a ladder suggesting polyubiquitylation of the GST-ubiquitin, whereas the LANA SOCS-box mutant did not (Figure 3D, left panel, lanes 6 and 7).

12574	In addition, in vivo proteasome inhibitor assays further showed that WT LANA was capable of significantly enhancing polyubiquitylation activities when compared to that of the LANA ΔSOCS mutant (Figure 3D, right panel, lanes 2 and 3)..

12576	Therefore, to determine whether this increase in levels of WT LANA could be attributed at least in part to potential stabilization of LANA by Elongin BC, WT LANA or the SOCS-box–like motif deletion mutant (ΔSOCS) was transiently expressed in Saos-2 cells with or without Elongin BC.

12578	The results showed that the level of WT LANA protein remained constant for at least 24 h after treatment of cyclohexamide to cells cotransfected with LANA along with Elongin BC (Figure 4A, left panel, and 4B).	[[166, 176], [40, 44], [150, 154], [37, 39]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'WT']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12579	However, in the absence of cotransfected Elongin BC when an SOCS-box deletion mutant of LANA was used, almost 50% of the LANA protein was lost within 5 h.	[[41, 51], [88, 92], [121, 125], [60, 64]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12580	Thus, WT LANA protein exhibits increased stability when coexpressed with Elongin BC (Figure 4A, right panel, and 4B).	[[73, 83], [9, 13], [6, 8]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'WT']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12581	In contrast to WT LANA, the ΔSOCS LANA mutant exhibited similar instability in the presence or absence of cotransfected Elongin BC (unpublished data), suggesting a requirement for the SOCS-box–like motif of LANA for enhanced stability..

12582	To determine the effect of LANA on targeted protein degradation, we examined the endogenous levels of some cellular tumor suppressors (such as p53 and VHL) expression in KSHV-positive (BCBL-1, JSC-1, BC-3, and BC-1) and -negative (BJAB, Louckes, and DG75) cell lines.	[[170, 174], [27, 31], [151, 154]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12583	Similar to previous studies which showed that p53 protein expression was decreased in KSHV-positive cells [17], our Western blot analysis of four KSHV-positive PEL cell lines showed that p53 levels were significantly reduced compared to KSHV-negative B cell lines (Figure 5A).	[[86, 90], [146, 150], [237, 241], [160, 163]]	[]	['KSHV', 'KSHV', 'KSHV', 'PEL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12584	Additionally, the levels of the HIF-1α–suppressor protein VHL were also reduced in KSHV-positive cells (Figure 5A).	[[83, 87], [58, 61]]	[]	['KSHV', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12585	To avoid the inconsistency of genotype among different cell lines, we also compared the levels of p53 and VHL in cell lines with the same genotypic background BJAB and KSHV-infected BJAB.	[[168, 172], [106, 109]]	[]	['KSHV', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12586	The resulting data further confirmed that levels of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and VHL did dramatically reduce after the KSHV infection (Figure 5B).	[[128, 132], [90, 93]]	[]	['KSHV', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12587	To determine that the results for both p53 and VHL inhibition was associated with LANA, stable 293 cell lines expressing LANA were generated.	[[82, 86], [121, 125], [47, 50]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12588	Similar results of tumor suppressor p53 and VHL inhibition by LANA were observed when immunoblotting (IB) assays were performed (Figure 5C).	[[102, 104], [62, 66], [44, 47]]	[[86, 100]]	['IB', 'LANA', 'VHL']	['immunoblotting']	PMC1626105.nxml
12589	To further confirm the role of LANA on p53 and VHL inhibition, LANA in the KSHV-positive BCBL-1 cell line was knocked down by the introduction of small interference RNA specifically against LANA.	[[75, 79], [31, 35], [63, 67], [47, 50]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12590	Again, analysis using IB assays showed that the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL were greatly rescued on inhibition of LANA expression (Figure 5D, left panel).	[[22, 24], [116, 120], [74, 77]]	[]	['IB', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12591	Furthermore, no obvious change was observed for p53 and VHL mRNA transcripts after LANA transcripts were decreased, supporting the hypothesis that LANA can induce the degradation of p53 and VHL proteins (Figure 5D, right panel)..	[[83, 87], [147, 151], [56, 59], [190, 193]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12592	We wanted to explore whether the potential mechanism for LANA-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL was related to LANA recruitment of the EC5S ubiquitin E3 ligase complex.	[[57, 61], [135, 139], [116, 119]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12593	As p53 was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of LANA [17], we first determined the binding domain of LANA with VHL with in vitro [35S]-labeled methionine translated proteins using the p53 protein as a positive control.	[[66, 70], [119, 123], [129, 132]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12594	The results of the in vitro pulldown assays showed that distinct from LANA binding to p53 through its carboxyl-terminal domain, the region of LANA binding to VHL was located in the amino-terminal domain using in vitro IP assays (Figure 6A).	[[218, 220], [70, 74], [142, 146], [158, 161]]	[]	['IP', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12595	Supporting in vivo IP assays further confirmed that full-length LANA was associated with the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL (Figure 6B)..	[[19, 21], [64, 68], [119, 122]]	[]	['IP', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12596	To determine the extent of the involvement of LANA recruitment of the EC5S E3 ligase for degradation of p53 and VHL, we utilized the specific SOCS-box mutant of LANA which lacks association with the EC5S complex.	[[46, 50], [161, 165], [142, 146], [112, 115]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12597	The constructs expressing p53, HA-ubiquitin (Ub), and WT LANA or its SOCS-deleted mutant were cotransfected into Saos-2 cells.	[[31, 33], [57, 61], [69, 73], [45, 47], [54, 56]]	[[34, 43]]	['HA', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'Ub', 'WT']	['ubiquitin']	PMC1626105.nxml
12598	The Western blot data showed that ubiquitylation of p53 in the presence of LANA was dramatically increased but minimally so when the ΔSOCS mutant of LANA was coexpressed (Figure 7A, left panel, lanes 4 and 6).	[[75, 79], [149, 153], [134, 138]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12599	Similarly, WT LANA also can induce VHL polyubiquitylation more efficiently when compared to the ΔSOCS mutant in VHL-deficient cell line 786-O (Figure 7A, right panel, lanes 10 and 12).	[[14, 18], [97, 101], [35, 38], [112, 115], [11, 13]]	[]	['LANA', 'SOCS', 'VHL', 'VHL', 'WT']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12600	Unexpectedly, the level of LANA could be seen to be decreased when p53 was coexpressed (Figure 7A, compare lane 5 with lanes 3 and 4) and slightly decreased when VHL was coexpressed (Figure 7A, compare lane 11 with lanes 10 and 12).	[[27, 31], [162, 165]]	[]	['LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12601	This indicated that although LANA can mediate degradation of the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL through interaction with its amino and carboxyl-terminal domains, the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL are also likely to contribute to regulation of LANA levels, as both are components of two separate E3 ligase complex that may also regulate LANA's activity, and these activities may functionally compete in virally infected cells [29,44]..	[[29, 33], [242, 246], [91, 94], [191, 194]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12602	To detect the specificity of LANA for targeting p53 and VHL for degradation, in vitro, LANA–Elongin BC–Cul5 complex ubiquitylation assays were performed using purified GST-p53 or GST-VHL as substrates.	[[168, 171], [179, 182], [29, 33], [56, 59], [183, 186]]	[]	['GST', 'GST', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12603	The results showed that only WT LANA could specifically recruit ubiquitin complex to induce GST-p53 or GST-VHL polyubiquitylation, but not its SOCS-deleted mutant or vector control in this in vitro assay (Figure 7B)..	[[92, 95], [103, 106], [32, 36], [143, 147], [107, 110], [29, 31]]	[]	['GST', 'GST', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'VHL', 'WT']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12604	As both p53 and VHL are components of two separate E3 ubiquitin complexes, we wanted to determine whether aberrantly expressed LANA can conquer p53 and VHL functions as components of E3 ubiquitin complex leading to their degradation in KSHV-infected cells.	[[236, 240], [127, 131], [16, 19], [152, 155]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12605	We tested the interaction of the tumor suppressor p53 or VHL with LANA at different expression levels, as well as the effect on one of their downstream effectors proteins, HIF-1α [29,44].	[[172, 178], [66, 70], [57, 60]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12606	As expression of LANA was increased without exogenous p53 or VHL coexpression, we found that LANA reduced levels of p53 and VHL in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S1A and S1B, right panels).	[[17, 21], [93, 97], [61, 64], [124, 127]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12607	As expected, when p53 was coexpressed with LANA and HIF-1α with increasing concentrations of p53, the levels of LANA as well as of HIF-1α levels were reduced, which was similar to expression of p53 and HIF-1α alone (Figure S1A, left panels).	[[52, 58], [131, 137], [202, 208], [43, 47], [112, 116]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'HIF-1α', 'HIF-1α', 'LANA', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12608	Similarly, increasing concentrations of VHL also inhibit LANA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S1B, left panels).	[[57, 61], [40, 43]]	[]	['LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12609	To determine the functional consequences of LANA on HIF-1α transcriptional activities in the context of p53 and VHL, reporter assays were performed using an HIF-1α response element reporter in various cell lines.	[[52, 58], [157, 163], [44, 48], [112, 115]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'HIF-1α', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12610	The reporter assays further confirmed that the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α was strikingly reduced when p53 and VHL were cotransfected, whereas increased levels of LANA coexpressed rescued HIF-1α transcriptional activity most likely through targeting and degrading the HIF-1α suppressors p53 and VHL (Figure S2).	[[75, 81], [195, 201], [275, 281], [170, 174], [118, 121], [302, 305]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'HIF-1α', 'HIF-1α', 'LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12611	Therefore, these results suggested that LANA expression is involved in regulating the degradation of the tumor suppressors p53 and VHL during KSHV-mediated oncogenesis, thus inhibiting their suppressive effects on HIF-1α transcriptional activities..	[[214, 220], [142, 146], [40, 44], [131, 134]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'KSHV', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12612	The KSHV-encoded latent protein LANA was originally identified as a major viral antigen whose expression plays a crucial role in replication and maintenance of the viral episomes in PEL cells [6,48–51].	[[4, 8], [32, 36], [182, 185]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA', 'PEL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12613	Here we demonstrated that the KSHV-encoded LANA protein interacts with the Elongin BC complex through the binding of Elongin C to the LANA BC-box motif located within its amino terminus.	[[75, 85], [30, 34], [43, 47], [134, 138]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'KSHV', 'LANA', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12614	The LANA–Elongin BC complex was capable of assembling with a Cullin/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex with ubiquitin ligase activity.	[[9, 19]]	[]	['Elongin BC']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12615	Furthermore, the facts that LANA only associated with Cul5, and not with Cul2, and that a mutation in the Cul-box motif of LANA at its carboxyl terminus abolished Cul5 binding in the absence of Elongin BC indicate that LANA can directly interact with Cul5.	[[194, 204], [106, 109], [28, 32], [123, 127], [219, 223]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'Cul', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12616	Interaction of the Elongin BC complex with the BC box markedly increased the stability of LANA protein, suggesting that it may be necessary to protect LANA from degradation in order to assemble the functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as previously proposed for SOCS-box family proteins [52,53].	[[19, 29], [90, 94], [151, 155], [265, 269]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12617	Thus, our results suggest that LANA can recruit the Elongin BC complex and Cul5/Rbx module through its SOCS-box–like motif to function as an EC5S ubiquitin ligase.	[[52, 62], [31, 35], [103, 107]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12618	Binding of the Elongin BC complex served to stabilize LANA, and binding to Cul5 provided a bridge to recruit Rbx1 and activate the ubiquitin-conjugating process..	[[15, 25], [54, 58]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12619	Therefore, identification of key regulators of angiogenesis in human cancers targeted for proteasomal degradation and mediated by KSHV-encoded LANA is highly significant.	[[130, 134], [143, 147]]	[]	['KSHV', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12620	Previous evidence has shown that HIF-1α is a critical regulator of numerous cellular growth factors and can also function as a regulator of tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis and is commonly overexpressed in a number of human cancers [43,54–56].	[[33, 39]]	[]	['HIF-1α']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12621	Recently, VHL and p53 have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of HIF-1α through ubiquitin-mediated degradation [29,44].	[[81, 87], [10, 13]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12622	In this study, we present data to show that the levels of the HIF-1α–suppressor protein VHL were dramatically decreased in KSHV-positive compared with KSHV-negative cells.	[[123, 127], [151, 155], [88, 91]]	[]	['KSHV', 'KSHV', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12623	Additionally, the tumor suppressor protein p53 was also significantly reduced in KSHV-infected cells as previously reported [17].	[[81, 85]]	[]	['KSHV']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12624	The WT LANA, but not mutant deleted for the SOCS-box motif, facilitated VHL and p53 ubiquitylation, suggesting that LANA is involved in the degradation of these HIF-1α–suppressor molecules and can function as an adaptor molecule to the EC5S ubiquitin ligase complex which contributes to the rescue of HIF-1α.	[[7, 11], [116, 120], [44, 48], [72, 75], [4, 6]]	[]	['LANA', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'VHL', 'WT']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12625	These findings shed light on the unique property of KSHV latently infected KS lesions predominantly seen in the lower extremities in elderly patients in whom oxygen is typically poor [57]..	[[75, 77], [52, 56]]	[]	['KS', 'KSHV']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12626	Interestingly, both Cul2 and Cul5 are known to be involved in ECS-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['ECS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12627	As to why LANA preferentially associates with the Cul5 and not the Cul2 protein, our data suggest that the Cul-box motif as well as additional sequences in the vicinity located in the carboxyl terminus of LANA may be important in this selection process.	[[107, 110], [10, 14], [205, 209]]	[]	['Cul', 'LANA', 'LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12628	The Cul5–Elongin BC complex was shown to interact with a number of SOCS-box–containing proteins, such as MUF1, ASB2, and the SOCS family of proteins [45,47,58].	[[9, 19], [67, 71], [125, 129]]	[]	['Elongin BC', 'SOCS', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12629	Although the mechanism by which Cul5 functions in these processes remains unclear, some viral proteins recruiting Cul5-containing ECS ubiquitin ligase have been shown to regulate the turnover of molecules involved in cell-cycle control, such as adenovirus E4 orf6 [59] and the HIV vif-1 proteins [46].	[[130, 133]]	[]	['ECS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12630	Here the interaction of LANA with Cul5 further emphasizes a role for Cul5 in the regulation of virus-mediated dysregulation of cell growth and oncogenesis..	[[24, 28]]	[]	['LANA']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12631	A major difference between the SOCS-box motif of KSHV LANA and the consensus SOCS-box sequence of cellular proteins is the greater distance between the BC box and the Cul box in this motif [30].	[[167, 170], [49, 53], [54, 58], [31, 35], [77, 81]]	[]	['Cul', 'KSHV', 'LANA', 'SOCS', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12632	Our data strongly suggest that this specific characteristic of the SOCS-box–like motif in ORF73 proteins encoded by other gammaherpesvirus is highly conserved and that this structure allows LANA greater flexibility for interaction with the Elongin C and Cullin proteins to achieve its function.	[[190, 194], [67, 71]]	[]	['LANA', 'SOCS']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12633	The fact that LANA can bind to VHL and p53 via its amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, respectively, inducing their degradation, is consistent with this hypothesis (Figure 8)..	[[14, 18], [31, 34]]	[]	['LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12634	It is noteworthy to mention that the cellular tumor suppressors VHL and p53 can also inhibit the ability of the viral protein LANA to regulate HIF-1α levels when they are highly expressed, as they can also act as adaptors of EC2S– and SCF–type E3 ligase complex, respectively.	[[143, 149], [126, 130], [64, 67]]	[]	['HIF-1α', 'LANA', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12635	Thus, the utilization of VHL-deficient 786-O cells or p53-deficient Saos-2 cells was critical for clearly defining the functional role of LANA in the regulation of VHL and p53 [29,44].	[[138, 142], [25, 28], [164, 167]]	[]	['LANA', 'VHL', 'VHL']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12636	This also indicates that the balance between the cellular mechanisms usurped by KSHV and the host cellular defense mechanisms is critical for determination of cell fate.	[[80, 84]]	[]	['KSHV']	[]	PMC1626105.nxml
12637	The higher levels of LANA expression in KSHV-infected cells are likely to be crucial to subdue the cellular defenses during KSHV infection (Figure S3), and this is consistent with the fact that LANA is highly expressed in KS and PEL cells [60–62]..

12773	Using p < 0.001 as a cutoff, we found 64 genes differentially expressed between NPR1-GR (glucocorticoid receptor; in npr1–3) and npr1–3 (Table S1).	[[85, 87]]	[[89, 112]]	['GR']	['glucocorticoid receptor']	PMC1635530.nxml

12778	We first examined individual wrky mutants for effects on BTH-induced resistance.	[[57, 60]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12779	Because mutating a single transcription factor would likely cause only a partial loss of resistance, we applied a moderate concentration of BTH (60 μM) followed by inoculation of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv.	[[140, 143]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml

12782	We then performed biological induction of SAR using P.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12783	As shown in Figure 3B, recognition of avrB led to enhanced resistance to subsequent challenge by Psm ES4326 in systemic leaves of WT plants.	[[97, 100]]	[]	['Psm']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12784	Since the npr1 mutant is impaired not only in SAR but also in basal resistance, we examined wrky18 for an enhanced disease symptoms (EDS) phenotype.	[[133, 136], [46, 49]]	[[106, 131]]	['EDS', 'SAR']	['enhanced disease symptoms']	PMC1635530.nxml
12785	Indeed, when we inoculated wrky18 with a low level of Psm ES4326 (OD600 = 0.0001), the EDS phenotype was also evident (Figure 3C and 3D).	[[87, 90], [54, 57]]	[]	['EDS', 'Psm']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12786	In all three cases, however, the phenotype of wrky18 was less severe than that of npr1–1, which is consistent with our hypothesis that WRKY18 is a downstream component of SAR that mediates a subset of NPR1 functions..	[[171, 174]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12787	We treated WT, wrky18, and npr1 plants with 60 μM BTH, and harvested leaf tissue at 0, 8, and 24 h after induction.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12788	Using ANOVA, the expression of 6,525 genes was found to be altered in WT following BTH treatment (p < 0.05) (after multiple testing correction using the method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg to assess false discovery rate [22]).	[[6, 11], [83, 86]]	[]	['ANOVA', 'BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12789	From this list, we applied a two-way ANOVA between WT and npr1 to identify NPR1-dependent genes.	[[37, 42]]	[]	['ANOVA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12790	Interestingly, almost all BTH-responsive genes were NPR1 dependent (2,248/2,280; 99%) (Figure 4A), highlighting the crucial role of NPR1 in BTH-mediated transcriptional reprogramming.	[[26, 29], [140, 143]]	[]	['BTH', 'BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12791	The effect of disrupting WRKY18 is moderate: the expression of 451 BTH-responsive genes (∼19.8%) was altered in this mutant (Table S4 and Figure 4A).	[[67, 70]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12792	The W box sequence was significantly overrepresented in the promoters of those genes for which the effect of BTH was diminished in wrky18: 2.3 copies per gene versus 1.7 copies at background level (p < 2.4 × 10−115) [24].	[[109, 112]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12793	These data clearly show that WRKY18 plays a positive role in SAR as an auxiliary transcription factor for a subset of NPR1-dependent genes..	[[61, 64]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12794	In an effort toward elucidating SAR transcriptional controls further downstream of NPR1, we generated plants carrying the WRKY18-GR construct.	[[129, 131], [32, 35]]	[]	['GR', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12795	Upon DEX treatment, WRKY18-GR complemented the EDS phenotype of the parental wrky18 mutant (Figure S1).	[[47, 50], [27, 29]]	[]	['EDS', 'GR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12796	Therefore, the GR fusion strategy can be applied again to identify direct transcriptional targets of WRKY18 and to dissect the complex SAR transcriptional network..	[[15, 17], [135, 138]]	[]	['GR', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12797	Although wrky58 showed no consistent difference from WT without induction or when resistance was induced by 60 μM BTH, we reasoned that WRKY58 might function at a suboptimal level of the inducer.	[[114, 117]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12798	Indeed, after treatment with a lower concentration of BTH (30 μM), wrky58 was clearly more resistant to Psm ES4326 than WT (Figure 5A).	[[54, 57], [104, 107]]	[]	['BTH', 'Psm']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12799	Furthermore, in the wrky58 wrky18 double mutant, the EDS phenotype of wrky18 was abolished (Figure 5B).	[[53, 56]]	[]	['EDS']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12800	The wrky58 mutation had no effect on SA levels (unpublished data), consistent with it being a downstream regulator.	[[37, 39]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12801	The role of WRKY58 may be to provide a safeguard mechanism for preventing spurious activation of defense responses at suboptimal levels of SA or to turn off SAR once the pathogen challenge subsides.	[[139, 141], [157, 160]]	[]	['SA', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12802	The enhanced resistance phenotype in wrky58 is not due to constitutive expression of PR genes (unpublished data), suggesting a new mode of regulating disease resistance for this transcription factor..	[[85, 87]]	[]	['PR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml

12805	We then surveyed the SA levels of the other seven wrky mutants and found that the wrky70 mutant accumulates free SA to a level significantly higher than that of WT in the absence of infection (Figure 6A).	[[21, 23], [113, 115]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12806	Although the single wrky54 mutant had normal SA levels, the wrky54 wrky70 double mutant showed a significantly higher level of free SA compared to wrky70 (Figure 6A).	[[45, 47], [132, 134]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12807	This high SA level was further elevated after induction by Psm ES4326 carrying the avrRpt2 gene (Figure 6A).	[[59, 62], [10, 12]]	[]	['Psm', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12808	Consistent with elevated SA levels, the SA biosynthesis gene ICS1 (encoding isochorismate synthase [10]) was clearly upregulated in wrky54 wrky70 (Figure 6B)..	[[25, 27], [40, 42]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12809	Accumulation of SA in naïve wrky70 and wrky54 wrky70 indicates that in WT plants, SA biosynthesis is actively repressed by basal levels of WRKY70 and WRKY54.	[[16, 18], [82, 84]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12810	The fact that SA levels can be further induced in wrky54 wrky70 suggests that during the onset of SAR, a positive regulator, possibly a transcriptional activator, is recruited to initiate SA synthesis.	[[14, 16], [188, 190], [98, 101]]	[]	['SA', 'SA', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml

12814	This suggests that WRKY70 and WRKY54 play dual roles in repressing SA biosynthesis and transducing the SA signal.	[[67, 69], [103, 105]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12815	This result is consistent with a recent report showing that in the same loss-of-function wrky70 mutant, SA-mediated resistance against the fungal pathogen Erysiphe cichoracearum was impaired [26]..	[[104, 106]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12816	Because the expression of WRKY53 and WRKY70 was highly correlated after SAR induction (r2 = 0.945; Spivey et al., unpublished data), we generated the wrky53 wrky70 double mutant.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12817	The double mutant had similar SA content to wrky70 (unpublished data), yet exhibited an EDS phenotype (Figure 6D and 6E).	[[88, 91], [30, 32]]	[]	['EDS', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12818	Taking advantage of the fact that many WRKY genes are inducible, we focused on one step of a specific signal transduction event and identified eight WRKY factors as important transcriptional regulators of SAR downstream of NPR1.	[[205, 208]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12819	The wrky18 mutation affected the amplitude of gene expression triggered by BTH (Figure 4C).	[[75, 78]]	[]	['BTH']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12820	Because the WRKY18 transcript levels remain high even beyond the 24-h induction period, this transcription factor may also be required to sustain SAR-related gene expression..	[[146, 149]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12821	It is possible that during SAR, WRKY18 releases the inhibitory effects of WRKY40 and WRKY60 to induce gene expression.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12822	Activation of SAR is a costly process involving dramatic induction of more than 1,000 genes (Figure 4B and Table S3; [28]).	[[14, 17]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12823	Therefore, SAR should only be activated when the benefit of resistance outweighs the costs.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12824	WRKY58 appears to be a negative regulator that functions at a suboptimal level of BTH to prevent spurious induction of SAR (Figure 1B).	[[82, 85], [119, 122]]	[]	['BTH', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12825	Characterization of both wrky70 and the wrky54 wrky70 mutants in our study provided new insights into another function of NPR1, namely the ability to curtail excessive SA accumulation.	[[168, 170]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12826	Hyperaccumulation of the ICS1 transcript and SA observed in these mutants (Figure 6) suggests that in WT plants, SA biosynthesis is actively repressed by low levels of WRKY70 and WRKY54.	[[45, 47], [113, 115]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12827	Because WRKY70 and WRKY54 are both NPR1 targets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they are also involved in shutting down SA biosynthesis once the pathogen challenge subsides (Figure 1B).	[[126, 128]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12828	The observation that free SA levels in the wrky54 wrky70 double mutant were further elevated in response to pathogen infection (Figure 6A) suggests that induction of SA biosynthesis involves a positive regulator.	[[26, 28], [166, 168]]	[]	['SA', 'SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12829	However, this regulatory gene is unlikely to be among the NPR1 targets examined in this study since SA biosynthesis occurs prior to activation of NPR1..	[[100, 102]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12830	In an earlier study, it was reported that reducing WRKY70 expression by an antisense construct did not change SA levels [20].	[[110, 112]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12831	It is possible that in addition to WRKY70, a related WRKY gene required for activating SA biosynthesis was also silenced.	[[87, 89]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12832	The presence of multiple W boxes in the promoter of the SA biosynthesis gene ICS1 [10] is consistent with this hypothesis..	[[56, 58]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12833	Unlike many reported SA-overaccumulating mutants, wrky54 wrky70 did not exhibit constitutive resistance to pathogens.	[[21, 23]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12834	In fact, this double mutant may have an EDS phenotype (unpublished data).	[[40, 43]]	[]	['EDS']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12835	We believe that WRKY70 and WRKY54 play dual roles during SAR: both as negative regulators of SA synthesis and as positive regulators of SA signaling (Figure 1B).	[[93, 95], [136, 138], [57, 60]]	[]	['SA', 'SA', 'SAR']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12836	If the sole function of WRKY70 were to repress SA biosynthesis, one would expect compromised resistance in plants with elevated WRKY70 expression.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['SA']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml
12837	Finally, our characterization of the wrky53 wrky70 double mutant suggests that WRKY53 also plays a positive role in activating defense responses, as this double mutant showed an EDS phenotype (Figure 1B)..	[[178, 181]]	[]	['EDS']	[]	PMC1635530.nxml

12911	Whereas EFV, TMC120, and TMC125 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 replication, NVP and DLV have 50% inhibitory concentrations for HIV-1 replication that are at least 10-fold higher [15,20,23,25]..	[[84, 87], [8, 11], [76, 79]]	[]	['DLV', 'EFV', 'NVP']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12914	Since the HIV-1 RT is expressed as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, it is conceivable that a molecule that modulates RT subunit interaction can also affect Gag-Pol/Gag-Pol interaction by binding to the embedded RT sequence, which could promote activation of the HIV-1 PR and viral polyprotein processing..

12920	To determine whether NVP, TMC120, and TMC125 also enhance p66 homodimerization, purified recombinant hexa-histidine tagged p66 (His-p66) was incubated in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of NNRTI with respect to total protein, and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

12922	TMC120 and TMC125 also enhanced p66 homodimerization, although the extent to which the p66 monomer was converted to the p66 homodimer was not as complete as for EFV, since detectable levels of monomers were observed.	[[161, 164]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12923	In contrast, NVP showed the weakest capacity to enhance p66 homodimerization.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['NVP']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12925	To determine whether EFV promotes homodimerization of a polyprotein expressing p66 we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to assess the effect of EFV on the interactions between “bait” and “prey” fusion constructs expressing a previously described 90-kDa model Pol construct comprising the C-terminus of nucleocapsid (NC), the transframe region, PR, RT, and the first 44 amino acids of IN [31,32].

12928	In contrast, when yeast expressing the Pol-bait and Pol-prey fusions were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of EFV we observed a dose-dependent increase in β-gal activity which increased 5-fold compared to the untreated control in the presence of 15 μM EFV (Figure 2).

12929	Yeast co-transformed with either the Pol-bait and the empty prey plasmid or the Pol-prey and the empty bait plasmid and grown in the absence or presence of EFV did not demonstrate detectable levels of β-gal activity, indicating lack of self-activation of the reporter gene by the model Pol fusion proteins in yeast.

12931	Since EFV enhances homodimerization of p66 and the model Pol polyprotein, we hypothesized that potent NNRTIs can enhance Gag-Pol/Gag-Pol interactions resulting in increased processing of Gag-Pol due to premature activation of the HIV-1 PR.	[[6, 9], [102, 107]]	[]	['EFV', 'NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12932	To investigate this hypothesis we analyzed the intracellular viral protein profile of pDRNL-transfected 293T cells treated with NNRTIs.	[[128, 133]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12933	The concentrations of NNRTIs tested were not cytotoxic (unpublished data) as determined by the CellTiter 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States).	[[22, 27]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12937	In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the Pr160gag-pol processing pattern in cells treated with DLV, NVP, and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, zidovudine (AZT), indicating that enhanced Gag-Pol processing is a property of potent NNRTIs..

12938	If enhanced processing of Pr160gag-pol by EFV, TMC120, and TMC125 is due to increased levels of HIV-1 PR activity in the cell, we would expect to see increased processing of Gag.	[[42, 45], [102, 104]]	[]	['EFV', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12939	Quantitative Western blot analysis of cell lysates probed with p24 antibodies demonstrated a 3.2- to 3.9-fold increase in the p24 to Pr55gag ratio in cells treated with EFV, TMC120, and TMC125 compared to untreated cells and cells treated with NVP, DLV, and AZT (Figure 3C and 3D).

12940	We also observed an increase in total Gag in cells treated with potent NNRTIs suggesting an accumulation of Gag inside the cell.	[[71, 76]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12941	However, consistent with enhanced processing of Pr55gag, we found that the ratio of intracellular Pr55gag to total Gag (including the processing intermediates and p24) in cells treated with potent NNRTIs was 50% of untreated cells or cells treated with the other inhibitors (unpublished data).	[[197, 202]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12942	Paradoxically, we observed an increase in the steady-state levels of the p41 and p25 Gag processing intermediates in cells treated with EFV, TMC120, and TMC125, suggesting an additional effect on Gag processing by these NNRTIs.	[[136, 139], [220, 225]]	[]	['EFV', 'NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12943	No significant change in the Gag processing pattern was observed in cells treated with NVP, DLV, and AZT with the p24 to Pr55gag ratios comparable to untreated cells (Figure 3C and 3D).	[[101, 104], [92, 95], [87, 90]]	[]	['AZT', 'DLV', 'NVP']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12944	Taken together, these data demonstrate that NNRTIs that enhance p66 homodimerization can enhance the intracellular processing of both HIV-1 Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins..	[[44, 49]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12945	In contrast to viral proteins in cell lysates, we observed no significant change in the processing pattern of Gag and Gag-Pol in virions from EFV-treated cells compared to untreated cells and cells treated with NVP and AZT.	[[142, 145], [211, 214]]	[]	['EFV', 'NVP']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12947	In contrast, we observed reduced levels of virus produced from cells treated with EFV compared to untreated cells and cells treated with NVP and AZT (Figure 4A and 4C) suggesting that EFV may affect viral particle production..

12949	To determine whether enhanced processing of Gag and Gag-Pol requires Gag/Gag-Pol localization to the plasma membrane, 293T cells were transfected with pGA2-NL4.3, a myristoylation-defective (myr-) HIV-1 mutant, in the presence of NNRTIs..

12953	Enhanced Gag and Gag-Pol processing in cells treated with potent NNRTIs and transfected with either wild-type or the myr(-) HIV-1 mutant support the notion that these drugs enhance viral protein processing within the cell..	[[65, 70]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12954	We have demonstrated that potent NNRTIs can increase intracellular processing of Gag and Gag-Pol, which is consistent with enhanced HIV-1 PR activity in the cell.	[[33, 38], [138, 140]]	[]	['NNRTI', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12957	Reduced viral particle production (60% decrease) was also observed in HIV-1-transfected HeLa cells treated with EFV (Figure 6C and 6D).	[[112, 115]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12958	These data suggest that the enhancement of intracellular viral protein processing mediated by potent NNRTIs leads to a reduction in viral particle production from HIV-1-transfected cells..	[[101, 106]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12959	The association between decreased viral particle production and enhancement of intracellular Gag and Gag-Pol processing suggests that EFV promotes the premature activation of the HIV-1 PR in the cell.	[[134, 137], [185, 187]]	[]	['EFV', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12960	Hence, inactivating the viral PR would be expected to negate the effect of EFV on viral particle production.	[[75, 78], [30, 32]]	[]	['EFV', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12961	To examine this possibility, 293T cells were transfected with PR(-)pNL4.3, which contains an active site mutation (D25A) in the HIV-1 PR, in the absence and presence of NNRTIs [34].	[[169, 174], [134, 136]]	[]	['NNRTI', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12976	Pol multimerization, leading to HIV-1 PR homodimerization and its activation, is the likely mechanism for our previous data demonstrating that EFV enhances processing of a model Pol polyprotein [31].	[[143, 146], [38, 40]]	[]	['EFV', 'PR']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml

12979	EFV also failed to decrease viral particle production of HIV-1 expressing the K103N mutation in the RT gene that confers EFV resistance indicating that the effect is specific to the drug binding to the HIV-1 RT in the context of Gag-Pol.

12985	In addition, our study underscores the importance of the RT domain and its propensity to dimerize in promoting Gag-Pol/Gag-Pol interactions and activation of the HIV-1 PR..	[[168, 170], [57, 59]]	[]	['PR', 'RT']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12986	The levels of enhancement of intracellular Gag and Gag-Pol processing as quantified by the increase in ratios of p24 to Pr55gag (for Gag) and p51 RT to p66 RT (for Gag-Pol) were in the range of 3.2- to 3.9-fold and 2- to 2.7-fold, respectively.	[[146, 148], [156, 158]]	[]	['RT', 'RT']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12987	The decrease in viral particle output for potent NNRTIs in the same cells as determined by pulse-labeling (Figure 6) was 33%–44%.	[[49, 54]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12988	Nevertheless, our data are consistent with the assertion that NNRTI enhancement of Gag and Gag-Pol processing is associated with a decrease in viral particle production..	[[62, 67]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12989	While we observed increased intracellular processing of Gag and Gag-Pol in the presence of potent NNRTIs, this effect was not detected in viral particles that were released in the culture supernatant.	[[98, 103]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12990	Our experiments with a myr (-) HIV-1 mutant clearly demonstrated a dramatic effect on enhanced processing of Pr55gag to p24 and p66 RT to p51 RT in 239T and HeLa cells treated with EFV, TMC120, and TMC125 compared to untreated cells.

12991	The impact of potent NNRTIs on the inhibition of viral particle production was observed at concentrations of inhibitor (5 μM) that are two to three orders of magnitude higher than levels required to inhibit HIV-1 replication in cell culture based assays (0.001–0.084 μM) [15,23,25].	[[21, 26]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12992	Nevertheless, the median plasma levels of EFV in drug-treated individuals is 7 μM indicating that the effect of the drug is at physiological concentrations [37].	[[42, 45]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12993	Furthermore, the intracellular concentrations of EFV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from drug-treated patients are similar to the total plasma concentrations of the drug [38].	[[49, 52]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12994	The large differences in potency of the drugs for inhibition of RT compared to viral particle production can be explained by the relative affinity of the drugs for the mature RT heterodimer and the proposed target for the late effect, p66 RT in the context Gag-Pol.	[[64, 66], [175, 177], [239, 241]]	[]	['RT', 'RT', 'RT']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12995	While the structure of the NNRTI binding site is well characterized in the RT heterodimer, its structure in the context of the Gag-Pol polyprotein is unknown.	[[27, 32], [75, 77]]	[]	['NNRTI', 'RT']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12996	It is possible that while potent NNRTIs can bind to p66 in Gag-Pol, the binding is weaker than its interaction with the RT heterodimer, thereby explaining the requirement for much higher concentrations of drug to observe an effect on viral particle production compared to inhibition of RT activity..

12997	In cells treated with potent NNRTIs we observed enhanced processing of Pr55gag to p24 CA.	[[29, 34]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12998	An accumulation of total Gag was also observed in cells treated with potent NNRTIs consistent with a decrease in viral particle output.	[[76, 81]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
12999	The first cleavage in Gag is between p2/NC, which would release the p6 late domain that is required for viral particle egress from the cell [40].	[[40, 42]]	[]	['NC']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
13000	Electron microscopy analysis of EFV-treated HeLa cells demonstrated a reduction in viral particle production compared to untreated cells and a higher proportion of immature particles attached to the plasma membrane (unpublished data).	[[32, 35]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
13001	These were generally single immature particles with stalks still attached to the plasma membrane, which were few in number but still greater in EFV-treated compared to untreated cells.	[[144, 147]]	[]	['EFV']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
13002	While the main defect we observed both by electron microscopy and biochemical analyses was a reduction in viral output, our data also suggest a secondary late domain defect, which could be attributed to enhanced Gag processing by potent NNRTIs..	[[237, 242]]	[]	['NNRTI']	[]	PMC1635531.nxml
13003	In contrast, there are several reports of small molecules or peptides that decrease virus processing and maturation, including the HIV-1 PR inhibitors [41,42], a 12-mer peptide that targets the CA domain of Gag [43], CAP-1, which targets CA [44], and 3-O-(3′,3′-dimethylsuccinyl)-betulinic acid (DSB) which targets the cleavage of the CA precursor resulting in a block in viral core condensation [45,46].

13028	Due to the importance of T cells in the anticryptococcal response, we studied the effect of GXM on the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to initiate a T-cell response.	[[131, 133], [92, 95]]	[[114, 128]]	['DC', 'GXM']	['dendritic cell']	PMC1635532.nxml
13029	GXM inhibited the activation of cryptococcal mannoprotein–specific hybridoma T cells and the proliferation of OVA-specific OT-II T cells when murine bone marrow–derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells.	[[169, 171]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13030	Inhibition of OT-II T-cell proliferation was observed when either OVA protein or OVA323–339 peptide was used as antigen, indicating GXM did not merely prevent antigen uptake or processing.	[[132, 135]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13031	We found that DCs internalize GXM progressively over time; however, the suppressive effect did not require DCs, as GXM directly inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3 antibody, concanavalin A, or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/ionomycin.

13032	Analysis of T-cell viability revealed that the reduced proliferation in the presence of GXM was not the result of increased cell death.	[[88, 91]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13033	Thus, we have defined a new mechanism by which GXM can impart virulence: direct inhibition of T-cell proliferation.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13034	The major virulence factor of Cryptococcus is its capsule, which is composed primarily of the polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM).	[[130, 133]]	[[109, 128]]	['GXM']	['glucuronoxylomannan']	PMC1635532.nxml
13035	GXM is taken up by macrophages in vitro and in vivo; however, little is known about the interaction between GXM and dendritic cells, which are the most potent cells capable of activating T cells.	[[108, 111]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13036	Because of the importance of T cells in the anticryptococcal response, the authors investigated the effect of GXM on the ability of dendritic cells to initiate a T-cell response.	[[110, 113]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13037	Furthermore, GXM had a direct, inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation, independent of the effect on dendritic cells.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13038	These findings may help explain the persistence of cryptococcal infections and suggest that GXM could be therapeutic in situations where suppression of T-cell responses is desired..	[[92, 95]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml

13054	Given the importance of the CMI response in the defense against Cryptococcus, we hypothesized that the organism's major virulence factor, GXM, would interfere with the ability of DCs to activate T cells.	[[28, 31], [179, 181], [138, 141]]	[]	['CMI', 'DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml

13069	Reduced T-cell proliferation could also be the result of impaired DC maturation, but we found GXM did not inhibit lipopolysaccharide- or tumor necrosis factor α–induced upregulation of MHC class II or CD86 on BMDC (unpublished data), suggesting GXM does not interfere with DC maturation..

[[170, 174], [59, 63], [172, 174], [77, 80], [156, 159]]	[[26, 57]]	['BMDC', 'BMMφ', 'DC', 'GXM', 'MDM']	['bone marrow–derived macrophages']	PMC1635532.nxml
13072	Purified CD4+ OT-II T cells were activated by BMMφ plus egg white, in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of GXM.	[[46, 50]]	[]	['BMMφ']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13073	While GXM at the lower concentrations tested (30 and 100 μg/ml) had no significant effect on T-cell proliferation, GXM at 300 μg/ml inhibited proliferation by 57 ± 9% (p < 0.01, n = 2).	[[6, 9], [115, 118]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13074	Thus, GXM-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation is observed whether DCs or macrophages present the antigen..	[[74, 76], [6, 9]]	[]	['DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13075	Accordingly, although some GXM was undoubtedly taken up by the APCs, there was likely GXM present extracellularly in contact with the T cells.	[[63, 66], [27, 30], [86, 89]]	[]	['APC', 'GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13076	Therefore, we questioned whether intracellular GXM would be sufficient to impair the ability of BMDCs to activate T cells.	[[96, 100], [98, 100], [47, 50]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13077	To investigate this, BMDCs were incubated with GXM and then washed to remove any GXM not bound or internalized before the addition of antigen and T cells.	[[21, 25], [23, 25], [47, 50], [81, 84]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13078	Pulsing of BMDCs with 100 μg/ml GXM before the addition of egg white had no effect on subsequent T-cell proliferation, and pulsing with 300 μg/ml had a minimal, inhibitory effect on proliferation (unpublished data).	[[11, 15], [13, 15], [32, 35]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13079	Thus, GXM-pulsing of BMDCs slightly reduced T-cell proliferation but not to the extent observed when GXM was added directly to the cocultures, suggesting GXM was having a direct effect on T cells.	[[21, 25], [23, 25], [6, 9], [101, 104], [154, 157]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13080	To investigate direct effects of GXM on CD4+ T cells, we first demonstrated that GXM bound to CD4+ T cells (unpublished data) and then used three stimuli that activate T cells independent of APC: concanavalin A (Con A), plate-bound anti-CD3ɛ antibody, and phorbol-12-myristate-13acetate (PMA)/ionomycin.	[[191, 194], [212, 217], [33, 36], [81, 84], [288, 291]]	[]	['APC', 'Con A', 'GXM', 'GXM', 'PMA']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13081	GXM at 100 μg/ml added to anti-CD3ɛ–activated T cells modestly increased proliferation; however, higher concentrations of GXM (300 and 1,000 μg/ml) significantly inhibited proliferation (Figure 4).	[[122, 125]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13082	GXM at 100 μg/ml had no effect on Con A–mediated T-cell proliferation, yet 300 μg/ml GXM inhibited proliferation by 60% (Figure 4).	[[85, 88]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13083	We also found GXM inhibited the proliferation of PMA/ionomycin-activated T cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 4).	[[14, 17]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13084	These data demonstrate that GXM has a direct, inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13085	To further investigate the reduced proliferative response, we sought to determine if GXM inhibits the upregulation of T-cell activation markers.	[[85, 88]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13086	GXM did not affect the upregulation of CD69 on T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (unpublished data).	[[83, 87], [85, 87]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13087	Similarly, GXM did not inhibit the upregulation of CD25 (unpublished data), which is the α-chain of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and another activation marker of T cells [21]..	[[11, 14], [118, 120]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13088	The decreased T-cell proliferation observed in the presence of GXM could be due to induction of necrosis or apoptosis.	[[63, 66]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13089	Therefore, we assessed the effect of GXM on T-cell viability by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining.	[[37, 40], [92, 94]]	[[74, 90]]	['GXM', 'PI']	['propidium iodide']	PMC1635532.nxml
13090	GXM at 300 μg/ml induced a small decrease in the percentage of live cells and a corresponding increase in the percentage of late apoptotic or dead cells when T cells were activated by anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (Figure 5).	[[197, 201], [199, 201]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13091	The addition of 1,000 μg/ml GXM to anti-CD3ɛ–activated T cells also resulted in a minimal, statistically insignificant increase in the percentage of late apoptotic or dead cells (unpublished data).	[[28, 31]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13092	However, this effect of GXM on T-cell viability is minimal and does not appear to be sufficient to account for the impaired proliferative responses.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13093	The effect of GXM on viability was also examined by adding the polysaccharide to cell lines and measuring proliferation.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13094	GXM at 300 μg/ml had no significant effect on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by a number of T cell lines and a B cell line, demonstrating that GXM is not directly cytotoxic (Figure S1).	[[147, 150]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13095	Taken together, these data indicate GXM-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation is not primarily due to cell death..	[[36, 39]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13096	We next sought to determine the effect of GXM on cytokine production by primary T cells.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13097	IL-2, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-γ, but not IL-4, were detected in supernatants of BMDCs/egg white/OT-II T-cell cocultures and T cells directly activated with anti-CD3ɛ (Figure 6 and unpublished data).	[[84, 88], [86, 88], [29, 32], [6, 8], [45, 47]]	[[17, 27]]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'IFN', 'IL', 'IL']	['interferon']	PMC1635532.nxml
13098	The presence of GXM resulted in reduced IL-2 levels when T cells were activated with anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (Figure 6).	[[98, 102], [100, 102], [16, 19], [40, 42]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13099	However, GXM had no significant effect on IL-10 or IFN-γ levels (unpublished data).	[[9, 12], [51, 54], [42, 44]]	[]	['GXM', 'IFN', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13100	Because IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor and is produced by activated T cells, the effect of GXM on IL-2 production was investigated further.	[[91, 94], [8, 10], [98, 100]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13101	Reduced levels of IL-2 in the presence of GXM could be due to a direct inhibition of IL-2 production or a result of fewer T cells due to an impaired proliferative response.	[[42, 45], [18, 20], [85, 87]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13102	To address the former possibility, we added exogenous IL-2 to T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ.	[[54, 56]]	[]	['IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13103	IL-2 at concentrations up to 100 U/ml did not restore the proliferative response of cells activated in the presence of 1,000 μg/ml GXM (68 ± 5% inhibition with GXM alone and 62 ± 13% with GXM plus 100 U/ml IL-2; mean ± SEM of two independent experiments performed in triplicate).	[[131, 134], [160, 163], [188, 191], [206, 208]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM', 'GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13104	We also examined the effect of GXM on the amount of IL-2 produced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated Jurkat T cells and found GXM had no significant effect on IL-2 production (PHA plus 300 μg/ml GXM = 110 ± 24% of IL-2 induced by PHA alone; mean ± SEM of three independent experiments done in triplicate).	[[31, 34], [129, 132], [198, 201], [52, 54], [162, 164], [217, 219], [89, 92], [179, 182], [233, 236]]	[[69, 87]]	['GXM', 'GXM', 'GXM', 'IL', 'IL', 'IL', 'PHA', 'PHA', 'PHA']	['phytohemagglutinin']	PMC1635532.nxml
13105	Together, these data reveal the inhibitory effect of GXM on T-cell proliferation cannot solely be attributed to impaired IL-2 production..	[[53, 56], [121, 123]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13106	To ascertain whether the effect of GXM on murine T-cell proliferation would be replicated using human cells, in the final set of experiments, we investigated whether the polysaccharide affected the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to the recall antigen, tetanus toxoid.	[[35, 38], [251, 255]]	[[215, 248]]	['GXM', 'PBMC']	['peripheral blood mononuclear cell']	PMC1635532.nxml
13107	In addition, as all of the above studies were performed using GXM from serotype A C.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13108	neoformans strain Cn6, in these experiments we also tested the effects of GXM isolated from other cryptococcal serotypes.	[[74, 77]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13109	Accordingly, PBMCs were activated with tetanus toxoid in the presence or absence of GXM isolated from serotype A C.	[[84, 87], [13, 17]]	[]	['GXM', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13110	GXM from all serotypes significantly inhibited PBMC proliferation, although the GXM preparations varied in their potencies (Figure 7).	[[80, 83], [47, 51]]	[]	['GXM', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13111	GXM isolated from the serotype A strains inhibited proliferation to the greatest extent; serotype D GXM was the least potent, and GXM from the serotype B and C strains were intermediate in their ability to suppress proliferation..	[[100, 103], [130, 133]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13112	The data presented herein establish a new mechanism by which the capsular polysaccharide GXM imparts virulence upon C.	[[89, 92]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13113	While GXM is taken up by DCs, inhibition of T-cell responses occurs in an APC-independent manner.	[[74, 77], [25, 27], [6, 9]]	[]	['APC', 'DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13114	Thus, GXM-mediated inhibition is seen regardless of whether T cells are activated by APC plus antigen or directly by mitogens.	[[85, 88], [6, 9]]	[]	['APC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13115	Moreover, GXM inhibits both murine and human T-cell responses..	[[10, 13]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13116	GXM inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by BMDCs presenting the immunodominant cryptococcal MP antigens.	[[46, 50], [48, 50], [95, 97]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'MP']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13117	Assuming these effects occur in vivo during cryptococcosis, the anticryptococcal CMI response may be dampened once a cryptococcal infection gets firmly established and GXM titers rise.	[[81, 84], [168, 171]]	[]	['CMI', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13118	As GXM also impairs humoral immune responses and phagocytic defenses [22], this could lead to a situation where the host is left without effective innate or acquired immunologic defenses.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13119	In addition to its effect on antigen-specific T-cell responses, GXM had a direct effect on primary, naïve T cells, as demonstrated by its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ or Con A.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13120	In those studies, the impaired proliferation may have been due to increased cell death, as GXM was found to induce apoptosis in these cells [24].	[[91, 94]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13121	In contrast, the impaired proliferative responses we measured could not be attributed to GXM-mediated cytotoxicity, as the polysaccharide did not significantly affect T-cell viability..	[[89, 92]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13122	GXM also inhibited the proliferation of T cells activated with the chemical mitogens PMA and ionomycin, indicating GXM interferes with T-cell signaling downstream of T-cell receptor activation.	[[115, 118], [85, 88]]	[]	['GXM', 'PMA']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13123	The presence of GXM resulted in less IL-2 detected in cultures of T cells activated with BMDC and egg white or anti-CD3ɛ.	[[89, 93], [91, 93], [16, 19], [37, 39]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13124	Likewise, GXM impaired the response of MP-specific T cells as measured by IL-2 production.	[[10, 13], [74, 76], [39, 41]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL', 'MP']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13125	However, exogenous IL-2 could not restore the proliferative response of T cells activated in the presence of a high concentration of GXM, and GXM did not inhibit IL-2 release by PHA-activated Jurkat cells.	[[133, 136], [142, 145], [19, 21], [162, 164], [178, 181]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM', 'IL', 'IL', 'PHA']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13126	Although it is possible GXM exerts different effects on cell lines and primary T cells, these data indicate GXM impairs T-cell proliferation independently of inhibiting IL-2 production or IL-2 receptor expression.	[[24, 27], [108, 111], [169, 171], [188, 190]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM', 'IL', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13127	Taken together, our results suggest that GXM exerts its effect at a later stage of T-cell activation.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13128	In fact, GXM may have a direct, inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression in primary T cells, similar to the action of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which inhibits IL-2–driven T-cell proliferation [27]..	[[9, 12], [185, 187]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13129	Studies from other laboratories have found that GXM induces the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, from human monocytes [28], and identified a role for IL-10 in GXM-mediated immunosuppression in vitro [23] and in vivo [29,30].	[[48, 51], [179, 182], [110, 112], [170, 172]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM', 'IL', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13130	However, we do not observe an induction of IL-10 by human monocytes or BMDCs incubated with GXM (unpublished data).	[[71, 75], [73, 75], [92, 95], [43, 45]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13131	Furthermore, GXM did not enhance IL-10 production from T cells activated with BMDCs plus egg white or anti-CD3ɛ.	[[78, 82], [80, 82], [13, 16], [33, 35]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13132	Thus, we conclude that GXM-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation in our studies likely is IL-10 independent..	[[23, 26], [96, 98]]	[]	['GXM', 'IL']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13133	In addition to the direct effect of GXM on T cells, we found DCs internalized the polysaccharide continuously over time, yet GXM-pulsed BMDCs were only minimally impaired in their ability to activate T cells.	[[136, 140], [61, 63], [138, 140], [36, 39], [125, 128]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13134	This is not surprising, as GXM treatment does not appear to inhibit BMDC maturation (unpublished data).	[[68, 72], [70, 72], [27, 30]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13135	Similarly, it was recently demonstrated that pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides are internalized by DCs yet do not inhibit LPS-induced maturation [31].	[[103, 105]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13136	Interference with antigen uptake or processing is also an unlikely mechanism for the inhibitory effect of GXM, as GXM effectively inhibited proliferation when T cells were activated with BMDCs plus OVA323–339 peptide..	[[187, 191], [189, 191], [106, 109], [114, 117]]	[]	['BMDC', 'DC', 'GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13137	Importantly, the inhibitory effect of GXM on murine T cells was also observed using human cells.	[[38, 41]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13138	We show that GXM inhibited proliferation of PBMCs activated with tetanus toxoid in a dose-dependent manner.	[[13, 16], [44, 48]]	[]	['GXM', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13139	A recent study demonstrated the other capsular component of Cryptococcus, GalXM, inhibits human T-cell proliferation by inducing T-cell apoptosis [32].	[[74, 79]]	[]	['GalXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13140	Consistent with our results, the researchers found a low concentration of GXM did not affect T-cell proliferation induced by PHA or anti-CD3.	[[74, 77], [125, 128]]	[]	['GXM', 'PHA']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13141	They did not examine the effects of higher concentrations of GXM, however..	[[61, 64]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13142	Interestingly, our studies revealed that GXM isolated from all four cryptococcal serotypes inhibited proliferation of tetanus toxoid–activated PBMCs, although not to the same extent.	[[41, 44], [143, 147]]	[]	['GXM', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13143	GXM from the serotype D strain B3501 was less inhibitory than GXM from the other strains.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13144	Differences in GXM structure affect virulence, inhibition of neutrophil migration, and tissue accumulation of GXM [33–35].	[[15, 18], [110, 113]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13145	GXM from B3501 is larger than GXM from H99 [4]; however, the molecular sizes of GXM from strains Cn6, R265, and Cn18 are unknown.	[[30, 33], [80, 83]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13146	Our results suggest differences in virulence between cryptococcal strains may be due in part to the varying capacities of GXM to inhibit T-cell proliferation..	[[122, 125]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13147	The concentrations of GXM we used that consistently inhibited T-cell proliferation (300 and 1,000 μg/ml) are high yet still biologically relevant.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13148	One study found 68% of AIDS patients with cryptococcosis had serum GXM titers of at least 1:1,024 (approximately 10 μg/ml), and 21% had titers of 1:10,000 or higher (approximately 100 μg/ml) [6].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13149	In experimental cryptococcosis, serum GXM levels in the mg/ml range have been observed [36].	[[38, 41]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13150	However, GXM concentrations in infected tissues, particularly at foci of infection, are undoubtedly much higher.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13151	Our findings suggest that such high concentrations of GXM could interfere with the generation of T-cell responses.	[[54, 57]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13152	In this regard, while the osmolarity of these high concentrations of GXM has not been determined, hyperosmotic stress has been reported to have direct effects on T-cell signaling pathways [37]..	[[69, 72]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13153	Furthermore, the ability of GXM to persist in patients after successful antifungal therapy underscores how T-cell responses during subsequent infections or neoplasia may be affected as well.	[[28, 31]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13154	Finally, GXM, or products derived from GXM, could prove to be of therapeutic value in situations where suppression of T-cell responses is desired, such as transplantation or autoimmunity..	[[9, 12], [39, 42]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13155	The strain Cn6 GXM used in Figures 1 through 6 and Figure S1 was in 1× PBS, whereas the GXM preparations used in Figure 7 were lyophilized and resuspended in RPMI 1640.	[[15, 18], [88, 91]]	[]	['GXM', 'GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml
13156	All GXM preparations had undetectable levels (less than 0.03 endotoxin U/ml) of endotoxin as measured by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States)..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['GXM']	[]	PMC1635532.nxml

13234	In addition, we identified 34 buried hydrophobic residues in EBA-175 F1, EBA-175 F2, and Pkα-DBL, which corresponded to hydrophobic residues buried in the DBL3X model (Figure S1).	[[93, 96], [61, 64], [73, 76], [89, 96]]	[]	['DBL', 'EBA', 'EBA', 'Pkα-DBL']	[]	PMC1636682.nxml

13236	One of the insertions in DBL3X (L1: R56-I63) was found to align structurally next to a region in Pkα-DBL, which is described as a flexible linker with an experimentally determined proteolytic cleavage site [16].	[[101, 104], [97, 104]]	[]	['DBL', 'Pkα-DBL']	[]	PMC1636682.nxml
13237	A second insertion (L2: N1417-E1430) was aligned in a loop region where two residues were missing structural information in the structure of EBA-175 F1 [15], which also indicates high flexibility.	[[141, 144]]	[]	['EBA']	[]	PMC1636682.nxml
13238	Thus, the alignment of DBL3X to the solved DBL domain structures seems to match characteristics such as disulfide-bridges, stabilizing hydrophobic interactions, and flexible loop regions.	[[43, 46]]	[]	['DBL']	[]	PMC1636682.nxml

13243	To further investigate the nature of sequence diversity in var2csa, the dN/dS ratios (dN, rate of non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site and dS, the rate of synonymous mutations per synonymous site) for DBL3X were calculated on the basis of the sequenced DBL3X domains.

13422	Consistently, we noticed that BepA-expressing bacteria, as well as the ectopic expression of a GFP–Bh BepA fusion protein alone, protected ECs against cell death triggered by a different CTL clone, which was activated by phytohemagglutinin in an MHC class I–independent manner (unpublished data).

13423	Together, these data indicate that translocated Bh BepA can effectively protect the chronically infected vascular endothelium against CTL-mediated cell death..	[[48, 50], [134, 137]]	[]	['Bh', 'CTL']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13424	In the case of Bh and Bq, the formation of vascular tumors in immunocompromised patients was shown to be linked to the inhibition of apoptosis of infected ECs [10].	[[15, 17], [22, 24], [155, 157]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bq', 'EC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13425	Deletion of the Bh bepA gene resulted in the complete loss of the anti-apoptotic activity of Bh, whereas expression of Bh bepA in trans restored the activity to wild-type level.	[[16, 18], [93, 95], [119, 121]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bh', 'Bh']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13426	Bh BepA was previously described as a putative substrate of the T4S system VirB/VirD4 [13]; we used the Cya reporter assay to demonstrate that Bh BepA is indeed translocated into ECs in a T4S-dependent manner.	[[143, 145], [104, 107], [179, 181], [64, 67], [188, 191]]	[]	['Bh', 'Cya', 'EC', 'T4S', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13427	Bh BepA is thus a genuine T4S effector that inhibits apoptosis upon translocation into HUVECs.	[[90, 92], [87, 92], [26, 29]]	[]	['EC', 'HUVEC', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13428	It is worth noting that we have been unable to show translocation of Bh BepA by CRAfT, an assay that we previously used to demonstrate translocation of several other Bh Beps [13].	[[69, 71], [166, 168], [80, 85]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bh', 'CRAfT']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13429	Nuclear import of the Cre reporter protein fusion is a prerequisite for a positive readout by CRAfT [13], suggesting that the negative readout obtained for Bh BepA fusions could result from protein recruitment to an intracellular localization that interferes with nuclear import.	[[156, 158], [94, 99]]	[]	['Bh', 'CRAfT']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13430	Indeed, ectopic expression of full-length Bh BepA fused to GFP revealed a prominent localization of the fusion protein to the plasma membrane, in contrast to the cytosolic localization of GFP alone.	[[42, 44], [59, 62], [188, 191]]	[]	['Bh', 'GFP', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13431	Unlike ectopically expressed GFP, the GFP–Bh BepA fusion also conferred protection against EC apoptosis.	[[42, 44], [91, 93], [29, 32]]	[]	['Bh', 'EC', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13432	These data demonstrate that Bh BepA is not only required but also sufficient for inhibiting EC apoptosis, and that this anti-apoptotic effector localizes to the plasma membrane.	[[28, 30], [92, 94]]	[]	['Bh', 'EC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13433	Moreover, ectopic expression of various parts of Bh BepA fused to GFP revealed a strict correlation of the capacity to mediate anti-apoptosis with localization to the plasma membrane (as opposed to the primarily cytoplasmic localization of fusions that did not cause anti-apoptosis).	[[49, 51], [66, 69]]	[]	['Bh', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13434	This finding indicates that plasma membrane targeting may be important for the anti-apoptotic activity of Bh BepA..	[[106, 108]]	[]	['Bh']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13435	In search of the cellular pathway by which Bh BepA mediates anti-apoptosis in ECs, we first tested whether an NFκB-dependent survival pathway is involved.	[[43, 45], [78, 80], [110, 114]]	[]	['Bh', 'EC', 'NFκB']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13436	rickettsii in ECs was reported to depend on NFκB activation [5], and we have previously shown that Bh activates NFκB in a VirB/VirD4- and Bep-dependent manner [13].	[[99, 101], [14, 16], [44, 48], [112, 116]]	[]	['Bh', 'EC', 'NFκB', 'NFκB']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13437	Here, we demonstrated that Bh BepA alone does not trigger the NFκB-dependent secretion of IL-8; even so, it fully protects against apoptosis.	[[27, 29], [90, 94], [62, 66]]	[]	['Bh', 'IL-8', 'NFκB']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13438	Thus, NFκB does not seem critical for Bh BepA–mediated anti-apoptosis.	[[38, 40], [6, 10]]	[]	['Bh', 'NFκB']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13439	Affymetrix GeneChip experiments indicated that Bh also triggers a cAMP signaling pathway in a T4S-dependent manner (M.	[[47, 49], [66, 70], [94, 97]]	[]	['Bh', 'cAMP', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13440	Here, we have shown that the anti-apoptotic activity of Bh BepA in HUVECs correlates with elevation of the intracellular cAMP level and results in the upregulation of cAMP-stimulated gene expression.

13441	Recently, it emerged that the regulation of apoptosis is an important facet of cAMP signal transduction [30,36–38].	[[79, 83]]	[]	['cAMP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13442	Moderately elevated cAMP levels were reported to protect several cell types against apoptosis, while the survival mechanisms differed from cell type to cell type and were considered to require the activation of protein kinase A, extracellular signal regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or guanine nucleotide exchange factor signaling pathways, which subsequently resulted in the expression of anti-apoptotic genes [23,36,37,39–44].	[[20, 24]]	[]	['cAMP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13443	In our system, the specific downstream signaling pathway mediating cAMP-dependent anti-apoptotis remains elusive: efforts to block putatively involved signaling molecules (i.e., protein kinase A) failed because of apparent cytotoxic effects of effective inhibitor concentrations during the extended time frame of the apoptosis assay..	[[67, 71]]	[]	['cAMP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13444	Importantly, a physiological rise in the intracellular cAMP level has been reported to fully protect ECs against apoptosis [45].	[[55, 59], [101, 103]]	[]	['cAMP', 'EC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13445	Consistent with this, we observed that increased cAMP levels caused by the combined action of the AC-activating drug forskolin and the phosphodiesterase-inhibiting drug IBMX resulted in a complete suppression of actinomycin D–induced apoptosis in HUVECs.	[[98, 100], [49, 53], [250, 252], [247, 252], [169, 173]]	[]	['AC', 'cAMP', 'EC', 'HUVEC', 'IBMX']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13446	Forskolin/IBMX-treated cells displayed an increase in the expression of cAMP-regulated genes similar to that observed upon infection with anti-apoptotic Bh strains.	[[153, 155], [72, 76], [10, 14]]	[]	['Bh', 'cAMP', 'IBMX']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13447	cAMP is produced in eukaryotic cells by the family of membrane-anchored ACs.	[[72, 74]]	[]	['AC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13448	Since the anti-apoptotic activity of Bh BepA in HUVECs is strictly associated with the plasma membrane localization of this effector, concomitant with an increase in the cAMP level, we propose that Bh BepA may trigger anti-apoptosis by interacting either with ACs directly, or with plasma membrane–associated heterotrimeric G proteins or G protein–coupled receptors that regulate AC activity..	[[260, 262], [380, 382], [37, 39], [198, 200], [170, 174], [51, 53], [48, 53]]	[]	['AC', 'AC', 'Bh', 'Bh', 'cAMP', 'EC', 'HUVEC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13449	Ectopic expression of GFP fusions with different parts of Bh BepA confined the anti-apoptotic activity to a region of 142 aa, which corresponds to the BID domain.	[[122, 124], [58, 60], [151, 154], [22, 25]]	[]	['aa', 'Bh', 'BID', 'GFP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13450	This conserved domain was previously shown to be present in a least one copy in all Beps of Bh and Bq [13,14,21].	[[92, 94], [99, 101]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bq']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13451	The BID domain plus the C-terminal positively charged tail sequence of the Beps was shown to constitute a bipartite translocation signal for T4S [13].	[[4, 7], [141, 144]]	[]	['BID', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13452	Interestingly, in contrast to the BID domain of Bh BepA, the conserved BID domains of the paralogs Bh BepB and Bh BepC have not been associated with anti-apoptosis.	[[48, 50], [99, 101], [111, 113], [34, 37], [71, 74]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bh', 'Bh', 'BID', 'BID']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13453	This indicates that subsequent to the expansion of this paralogous protein family by gene duplication, the Bh BepA BID domain acquired, in addition to its crucial function as a signal for T4S, the capacity to mediate anti-apoptosis.	[[107, 109], [115, 118], [188, 191]]	[]	['Bh', 'BID', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13454	It may be speculated that the BID domain represents a basic fold that mediates a protein–protein interaction with the T4S machinery that is crucial for protein translocation, and that in Bh BepA this basic fold is adapted to also mediate specific interaction with the plasma membrane–associated, cAMP-generating signaling cascade of ECs..	[[187, 189], [30, 33], [296, 300], [333, 335], [118, 121]]	[]	['Bh', 'BID', 'cAMP', 'EC', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13455	Each of the paralogs Bh BepA, Bh BepB, and Bh BepC carries in the N-terminal region one copy of the FIC domain.	[[21, 23], [30, 32], [43, 45], [100, 103]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bh', 'Bh', 'FIC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13456	While this conserved domain of unknown function might be important for the effector function of Bh BepB and Bh BepC, our results demonstrate that the FIC domain is dispensable for the anti-apoptotic activity of Bh BepA.	[[96, 98], [108, 110], [211, 213], [150, 153]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bh', 'Bh', 'FIC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13457	Interestingly, an internal stop codon and downstream-located start codon within the bepA ortholog of Bq split this locus into two separate open reading frames (Bq bepA1 and Bq bepA2).	[[101, 103], [160, 162], [173, 175]]	[]	['Bq', 'Bq', 'Bq']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13458	Bq BepA1 has the FIC domain but lacks a T4S signal, and thus cannot be translocated into ECs.	[[89, 91], [17, 20], [40, 43]]	[]	['EC', 'FIC', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13459	In contrast, Bq BepA2 consists only of the T4S signal, which we have shown mediates both T4S-dependent translocation and anti-apoptosis in ECs.	[[13, 15], [139, 141], [43, 46], [89, 92]]	[]	['Bq', 'EC', 'T4S', 'T4S']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13460	It thus appears plausible that the functional diversification of BepA into an anti-apoptotic effector occurred in the common ancestor of the closely related species Bh and Bq [21], and that following speciation the acquisition of additional mutations resulted in the elimination of the dispensable N-terminal FIC domain in Bq..	[[165, 167], [172, 174], [323, 325], [309, 312]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bq', 'Bq', 'FIC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13461	Interestingly, unlike Bh BepA and Bq BepA2, the BepA ortholog of Bt does not mediate any anti-apoptotic activity, nor any measurable activation of the cAMP pathway.	[[22, 24], [34, 36], [65, 67], [151, 155]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bq', 'Bt', 'cAMP']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13462	This observation is in agreement with the previously reported finding that, among the bartonellae, the anti-apoptotic activity is limited to the vasoproliferative species Bh and Bq [10]..	[[171, 173], [178, 180]]	[]	['Bh', 'Bq']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13463	To asses if the here identified anti-apoptotic activity of Bh BepA might be able to protect the cellular habitat of Bh during the infection process, we used a co-culture system of HUVECs with human CTLs.

13464	CTLs execute cell-mediated immunity, an immune mechanism probably involved in the elimination of Bh infection [9,12,47].	[[97, 99]]	[]	['Bh']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13465	Upon recognition of MHC class I–displaying microbial peptides, CTLs are activated to kill their target cells by the release of perforin and granzymes [31,48].	[[63, 66], [20, 23]]	[]	['CTL', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13466	In our study, we used a CTL clone that is activated in an MHC class I–restricted manner by extracellular loading of HLA-A2-positive HUVECs with an HLA-A2-specific peptide (SMCY).	[[24, 27], [135, 137], [132, 137], [58, 61]]	[]	['CTL', 'EC', 'HUVEC', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13467	Such activated CTLs kill their target cells in a perforin-dependent manner [32], primarily by triggering granzyme-dependent apoptosis [50,51].	[[15, 18]]	[]	['CTL']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13468	Bh BepA–expressing strains indeed inhibited CTL-triggered EC apoptosis, indicating that the biological function of Bh BepA expression in vivo might be to protect the integrity of its colonized cellular niche.	[[115, 117], [44, 47], [58, 60]]	[]	['Bh', 'CTL', 'EC']	[]	PMC1657063.nxml
13469	The Bh BepA–mediated resistance of ECs to CTL-dependent cell death points towards an important role of BepA in escaping cell-mediated immunity and thus in protecting the integrity of the chronically infected vasculature, which is a prerequisite for vascular proliferation.

13548	Infection of Mtv-null mice with an MMTV-related retrovirus, type B leukemogenic virus, also resulted in severely reduced viral loads and failure to induce T-cell lymphomas, indicating that resistance is not dependent on expression of a superantigen (Sag) encoded by exogenous MMTV.	[[35, 39], [13, 16], [250, 253]]	[[236, 248]]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	['superantigen']	PMC1665650.nxml

13555	Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a retrovirus that causes breast cancer in mice.	[[27, 31]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13556	Mice become infected by virus particles in mother's milk (exogenous MMTV), and insertion of exogenous MMTV into somatic cell DNA sporadically leads to genetic damage and cancer.	[[68, 72], [102, 106]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13557	Alternatively, if exogenous MMTVs infect germline cells, the viral genome becomes a stable part of the mouse genome and may be inherited from either parent (endogenous MMTV).	[[28, 32], [168, 172]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13558	In this report, the authors demonstrate that mice carrying endogenous MMTV in their genomes are more susceptible to disparate infectious agents, such as exogenous MMTV and the cholera-producing bacteria, Vibrio cholerae.	[[70, 74], [163, 167]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13559	Genetic evidence suggests that a viral protein produced by endogenous MMTVs enhances pathogen-induced disease and death.	[[70, 74]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13560	Further, the human genome contains many human endogenous virus type Ks, which highly resemble MMTVs and also may influence disease.	[[94, 98]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13561	One group of pattern recognition receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to humans and is expressed by a variety of cell types [3].	[[69, 72]]	[]	['TLR']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13562	Retroviruses, including the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), represent one group of pathogens that uses cells of the immune system to establish infection [6,7].	[[70, 74]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13563	MMTV is transmitted as exogenous virus through the milk of infected female mice to newborn pups or through endogenous proviruses (Mtvs) integrated in the germline [8].	[[130, 133]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13564	Recently, we have shown that MMTV is a complex retrovirus with features similar to the human retroviruses, human endogenous retroviruses type K (HERV-K), HIV, and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) [9]..	[[29, 33]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13565	In the first few weeks of life, milk-borne MMTV enters the small intestine, where it penetrates M cells of the epithelial layer to invade the underlying lymphoid tissue [10].	[[43, 47]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13566	B lymphocytes and dendritic cells are the initial targets of MMTV infection [11].	[[61, 65]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13567	These infected antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express virus-encoded superantigen (Sag), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, at the cell surface in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules [12].	[[41, 44], [83, 86]]	[[15, 38], [69, 81]]	['APC', 'Sag']	['antigen-presenting cell', 'superantigen']	PMC1665650.nxml
13568	Sag-MHC complexes on APCs interact with particular variable regions on the β chains (Vβ) of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to initiate a helper T-cell response [11].	[[21, 24], [110, 113], [85, 87]]	[]	['APC', 'TCR', 'Vβ']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13569	Unlike conventional antigens, these APC interactions allow activation of 5% to 35% of naïve CD4+ T cells, which then release cytokines to induce rapid proliferation of bystander cells that are susceptible to MMTV infection [13].	[[36, 39], [208, 212]]	[]	['APC', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13570	Dividing lymphocytes provide a reservoir of mobile infected cells, which subsequently transmit MMTV to dividing mammary cells during puberty [14].	[[95, 99]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13571	Later during infection, there is gradual deletion or anergy of the Sag-reactive T cells [15].	[[67, 70]]	[]	['Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13572	Thus, Sag plays an essential role in T-cell stimulation to establish milk-borne MMTV infection.	[[80, 84], [6, 9]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13573	Disruption of T-B cell interactions, which occurs in CTLA4 immunoglobulin-transgenic mice [16], or mice carrying several different knockout mutations (Foxn1, immunoglobin heavy chain, CD40L, or CD28) [17–20], reduces or abolishes the Sag-mediated immune response as well as viral spread and transmission..	[[234, 237]]	[]	['Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13574	Common laboratory mice carry between two and eight Mtv proviruses that often are defective for replication and fail to produce infectious particles [21].	[[51, 54]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13575	However, most Mtvs encode functional Sags that induce intrathymic or peripheral deletion of Sag-reactive T cells [22].	[[14, 17], [37, 40], [92, 95]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13576	These Sags are polymorphic at their C-termini, which interact only with specific TCRs [23].	[[6, 9], [81, 84]]	[]	['Sag', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13577	Thus, endogenous Mtv proviruses reshape the adaptive immune system by altering the T-cell repertoire of the mouse [24] and may potentially facilitate milk-borne MMTV infection by generating partial tolerance to virally encoded proteins.	[[161, 165], [17, 20]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13578	Further, mice transgenic for the sag gene of C3H strain MMTV are protected against exogenous MMTVs encoding the same Sag specificity, leading to the hypothesis that endogenous Mtvs are maintained to provide protection from milk-borne MMTV infection [6]..	[[56, 60], [93, 97], [234, 238], [176, 179], [117, 120]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13579	In addition, MMTV SU binds to TLR2 and TLR4, and this interaction is believed to trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as the upregulation of the entry receptor CD71 [26].	[[13, 17]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13580	Cytokine secretion is diminished from APCs if the cells have a double mutation in TLR2 and TLR4 or if cells are tolerized by prior exposure to lipopolysaccharide [26].	[[38, 41]]	[]	['APC']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13581	These results indicate that MMTV manipulates both the innate and adaptive immune responses through virally encoded SU and Sag..	[[28, 32], [122, 125]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13582	In this study, we have developed BALB/c congenic mice that lack all endogenous Mtvs (BALB/Mtv-null).	[[79, 82], [90, 93]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13583	These mice are resistant to mammary tumorigenesis and leukemia induction by two different MMTV strains, as well as mortality induced by the Gram-negative pathogen, Vibrio cholerae.	[[90, 94]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13584	Both viral and bacterial loads are diminished in Mtv-null animals compared to their Mtv-positive littermates, and this phenotype is reversed by restoration of any one of three endogenous Mtvs found in BALB/c mice.	[[49, 52], [84, 87], [187, 190]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13585	Since at least one of the endogenous Mtvs appears to encode only superantigen, our data suggest that MMTV Sag is a negative regulator of the innate immune response to multiple pathogens..	[[101, 105], [37, 40], [106, 109]]	[[65, 77]]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	['superantigen']	PMC1665650.nxml
13586	To obtain Mtv-null mice on the BALB/c background, we mated BALB/c females (H-2d) to males from the recently inbred PERA/Ei (H-2k) strain that lack endogenous Mtvs [27].	[[10, 13], [158, 161]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13587	Subsequently, N1 mice were screened for the absence of endogenous Mtvs using PCR from tail-derived genomic DNA, and Mtv-free progeny were then mated to BALB/c mice.	[[66, 69], [116, 119]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13588	Every other generation, the progeny were intercrossed to obtain Mtv-free animals that were then backcrossed to BALB/c.	[[64, 67]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13589	This strategy was continued for ten generations to obtain the Mtv-null strain (H-2d), which has been maintained by brother-sister matings for more than 3 y..	[[62, 65]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13590	The absence of endogenous Mtvs was verified by PCR analysis of mouse genomic DNA using primers specific for each of the three endogenous MMTV proviruses of BALB/c mice, Mtv6, 8, and 9 (Figure 1A).	[[137, 141], [26, 29]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13591	The lack of Mtvs was also confirmed by flow cytometry to detect the levels of specific T cells (Figure 1B).	[[12, 15]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13592	Deletion of specific T-cell subsets is a sensitive indicator of the expression of MMTV superantigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells [28].	[[82, 86]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13593	As expected, BALB/c mice had very low levels of CD4+ T cells reactive with Sags encoded by Mtv6, 8, and 9 proviruses (TCR variable-region beta [Vβ] 3, 5, 7, and 12).	[[75, 78], [118, 121]]	[]	['Sag', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13594	However, significant populations of these same T-cell subsets were detected in Mtv-null mice, consistent with the absence of the corresponding endogenous MMTV proviruses.	[[154, 158], [79, 82]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13595	Further, Southern blotting of genomic DNA from Mtv-null animals and hybridization with MMTV long terminal repeat-specific probes confirmed the absence of proviruses (unpublished data).	[[87, 91], [47, 50]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13596	Together, these data indicate that BALB/Mtv-null mice are free from endogenous Mtvs..	[[40, 43], [79, 82]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13597	To determine the susceptibility of BALB/Mtv-null mice to MMTV infection, Mtv-null pups were allowed to nurse on C3H MMTV-infected mothers (C3H/HeN MMTV+ mice) (foster nursing).	[[57, 61], [116, 120], [40, 43], [73, 76]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13598	This method allows the natural milk-borne transmission of MMTV from mothers to offspring.	[[58, 62]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13599	As anticipated, milk-borne MMTV infection of wild-type BALB/c mice gave a 100% incidence of mammary tumors with an average latency of 5.8 ± 0.4 mo (Table 1).	[[27, 31]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13600	However, milk-borne infection of Mtv-null mice only gave a 10% incidence of mammary tumors (one of ten animals) with the only tumor appearing at 15 mo..	[[33, 36]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13601	Mice were also infected by inoculation with rat XC fibroblasts stably expressing an infectious cloned MMTV provirus, HYB-MTV [29].	[[117, 124], [102, 106]]	[]	['HYB-MTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13602	The stably transfected cells (XC/HYB-MTV) [30] were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c and Mtv-null weanlings.	[[33, 40], [95, 98]]	[]	['HYB-MTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13603	Wild-type mice developed mammary tumors with an incidence of 90% and an average latency of 8.9 ± 2.2 mo, whereas Mtv-null mice had a 10% mammary tumor incidence (three of 29 animals inoculated) with an average latency of 12.7 ± 3.2 mo (Table 1).	[[113, 116]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13604	Therefore, the difference between Mtv-null and BALB/c animals in disease susceptibility was not influenced by the route of viral infection..	[[34, 37]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13605	One explanation for these results is that MMTV infection is limited in Mtv-null mice and reduced replication of the virus leads to a decreased frequency of proviral integration into the cellular genome.	[[42, 46], [71, 74]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13606	Since deletion of superantigen-reactive T cells is a sensitive indicator of MMTV infection, MMTV-infected animals were analyzed for Sag-specific T-cell deletion..	[[76, 80], [92, 96], [132, 135]]	[[18, 30]]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Sag']	['superantigen']	PMC1665650.nxml
13607	As anticipated, wild-type BALB/c animals inoculated with MMTV-infected rat cells showed statistically significant (69%) deletion of C3H MMTV Sag-reactive (CD4+Vβ14+) T cells compared to uninfected BALB/c mice (Figure 1C, left panel).	[[57, 61], [136, 140], [141, 144]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13608	In contrast, Mtv-null mice inoculated with the same infected cells showed no detectable C3H Sag-specific T-cell deletion (Figure 1D, left panel).	[[13, 16], [92, 95]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13609	T-cell deletion was specific since there was no observable deletion in a T-cell subset that is non-reactive with C3H MMTV Sag protein (CD4+Vβ8+; Figure 1C and 1D, right panels).	[[117, 121], [122, 125]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13610	These results are consistent with the idea that MMTV replication is restricted in Mtv-null mice, thus reducing proviral loads and mammary tumorigenesis.	[[48, 52], [82, 85]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13611	Deletion of Sag-specific T cells was also not detectable in progeny of MMTV-infected Mtv-null mothers (unpublished data)..	[[71, 75], [85, 88], [12, 15]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13612	To determine whether there was a difference in viral loads between MMTV-inoculated BALB/c and Mtv-null mice, spleen RNA was obtained from multiple infected animals and subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR using long terminal repeat primers that were specific for C3H MMTV (Figure 2A).	[[67, 71], [268, 272], [94, 97]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13613	Exogenous MMTV RNA levels were consistently higher in BALB/c mice than in Mtv-null animals inoculated with HYB-MTV infected cells.	[[107, 114], [10, 14], [74, 77]]	[]	['HYB-MTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13614	Similar data were obtained using tissues from mice infected with MMTV by foster nursing (Figure 2A).	[[65, 69]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13615	Also, note that MMTV RNA was barely detectable in Mtv-null mammary tumors (Figure 2A, lane 18, and unpublished data), but was easily detected in the BALB/c tumors (lanes 19 and 20).	[[16, 20], [50, 53]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13616	These results indicate that Mtv-null mice have reduced viral loads after MMTV infection..	[[73, 77], [28, 31]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13617	Sag-mediated amplification of MMTV in lymphoid cells is required for efficient viral transmission and dissemination in the mammary gland [6,14].	[[30, 34]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13618	Therefore, resistance of Mtv-null mice to MMTV-induced disease could be attributed to reduced Sag function in these animals.	[[42, 46], [25, 28], [94, 97]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13619	To test this possibility, we analyzed infection by an MMTV variant, TBLV, which induces T-cell tumors rather than mammary cancers [34,35], by a Sag-independent mechanism [34].	[[54, 58], [144, 147], [68, 72]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13620	Injection of TBLV-infected cells intraperitoneally into weanling BALB/c mice gave a 50% incidence of T-cell lymphomas with an average latency of 5.7 mo.	[[13, 17]]	[]	['TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13621	In contrast, BALB/Mtv-null mice inoculated in the same manner failed to develop lymphomas within the 10-mo observation period (Table 1).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13622	Similarly, BALB/Mtv-null mice did not develop lymphomas after injection with a TBLV mutant that encodes only 17 amino acids of Sag, whereas this same mutant was lymphomagenic in BALB/c mice (unpublished data) [34].	[[16, 19], [127, 130], [79, 83]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13623	Thus, both Sag-dependent and Sag-independent MMTV strains have reduced tumorigenicity in Mtv-null mice..	[[45, 49], [89, 92], [11, 14], [29, 32]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13624	To test whether resistance of Mtv-null mice affects viral replication, we performed RT-PCR analyses on RNA extracted from tissues of TBLV-inoculated mice.	[[30, 33], [133, 137]]	[]	['Mtv', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13625	Viral loads were greatly reduced in the infected Mtv-null mice compared to those from infected BALB/c animals.	[[49, 52]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13626	Since viral RNA was detected only sporadically, our results suggest that Mtv-null mice are less susceptible to MMTV and TBLV infection.	[[111, 115], [73, 76], [120, 124]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13627	Nevertheless, viral RNA cannot be demonstrated in every organ of MMTV or TBLV-infected wild-type BALB/c mice (unpublished data), a result that might be expected from the negative regulation of MMTV transcription in most tissues except lactating mammary gland [36,37].	[[65, 69], [193, 197], [73, 77]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13628	Together with the lack of Sag-specific T-cell deletion observed in Mtv-null mice infected by MMTV (Figure 1), these experiments suggest that Mtv-null mice restrict both TBLV and MMTV replication..	[[93, 97], [178, 182], [67, 70], [141, 144], [26, 29], [169, 173]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Mtv', 'Sag', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13629	To determine the gene(s) involved in the resistance of BALB/Mtv-null mice to MMTV and TBLV infection, we obtained F1 hybrids between BALB/c and Mtv-null mice.	[[77, 81], [60, 63], [144, 147], [86, 90]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Mtv', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13630	Weanling F1 animals were injected intraperitoneally with MMTV-infected rat cells and observed for Sag-reactive T-cell deletion and development of mammary tumors.	[[57, 61], [98, 101]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13631	Deletion of C3H-MMTV Sag-specific (Vβ14+) T cells was detected in all MMTV-infected F1 animals similar to that observed with infected wild-type BALB/c mice (Figure 3A).	[[16, 20], [70, 74], [21, 24]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13632	Deletion was not observed in the Sag non-reactive T-cell population (Vβ8+) (Figure 3F).	[[33, 36]]	[]	['Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13633	RT-PCR was used to identify expression of C3H MMTV in these tumors.	[[46, 50]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13634	As anticipated, these tumors expressed MMTV RNA as detected by RT-PCR, and cleavage of the products with ClaI was consistent with the presence of C3H MMTV transcripts (unpublished data).	[[39, 43], [150, 154]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13635	Therefore, resistance of the Mtv-null mice to mammary tumors as well as Sag-specific T-cell deletion is a recessive trait..	[[29, 32], [72, 75]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13636	During the establishment of the Mtv-null strain, we noted that the resistance to MMTV-induced mammary tumors was retained after six backcross generations.	[[81, 85], [32, 35]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13637	To determine whether the resistance of Mtv-null mice segregates with any of the endogenous Mtv loci of BALB/c mice, we derived BALB/c congenic strains carrying single Mtv proviruses called BALB/Mtv6, BALB/Mtv8, and BALB/Mtv9 (single-positive strains).	[[39, 42], [91, 94], [167, 170]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Mtv', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13638	The same crosses also yielded siblings that lacked all three endogenous MMTV proviruses.	[[72, 76]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13639	The presence or absence of endogenous Mtvs in these strains was verified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) (unpublished data)..	[[38, 41], [159, 162]]	[[129, 156]]	['Mtv', 'PBL']	['peripheral blood lymphocyte']	PMC1665650.nxml
13640	Weanling single-positive strains were inoculated intraperitoneally with MMTV-infected rat cells and observed for deletion of Sag-reactive T cells and for the development of mammary tumors.	[[72, 76], [125, 128]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13641	Interestingly, all three single-positive strains demonstrated equivalent C3H MMTV-specific T-cell deletion with similar kinetics (Figure 3B–3D).	[[77, 81]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13642	As expected, BALB/Mtv-null siblings showed no deletion (Figure 3E).	[[18, 21]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13643	Moreover, the Sag non-reactive T-cell population (Vβ8+) was not affected (Figure 3F–3J), validating the specificity of the deletion observed..	[[14, 17]]	[]	['Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13644	Mice carrying single Mtv proviruses were also susceptible to C3H MMTV-induced mammary tumors (Table 1).	[[65, 69], [21, 24]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13645	Three of the 29 injected Mtv-null mice also developed mammary tumors (∼10% incidence).	[[25, 28]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13646	The tumor incidence of BALB/c mice carrying single Mtv proviruses was statistically higher than those lacking MMTV proviruses.	[[110, 114], [51, 54]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13647	Expression of C3H MMTV RNA was verified in mammary tumors using RT-PCR with virus-specific primers followed by cleavage of the products with ClaI (unpublished data).	[[18, 22]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13648	Because Mtv6, 8, and 9 are located on different mouse chromosomes, these results suggest that susceptibility to Sag-mediated deletion and mammary tumorigenesis is conferred by the presence of any of three endogenous Mtv proviruses rather than linked cellular genes..	[[216, 219], [112, 115]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13649	Since a single endogenous Mtv provirus is sufficient to allow Sag-mediated deletion and MMTV-induced mammary tumors, it is possible that BALB/c mice have immune tolerance to MMTV-encoded proteins.	[[88, 92], [174, 178], [26, 29], [62, 65]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13650	If this is true, then Mtv-null mice may have a strong neutralizing antibody response against virion antigens that limits the infection [38].	[[22, 25]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13651	To test this idea, BALB/c and Mtv-null mice were infected by nursing on MMTV-infected C3H/HeN mothers and then tested at weekly intervals for MMTV-specific antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Figure 4A).	[[208, 213], [72, 76], [142, 146], [30, 33]]	[[173, 206]]	['ELISA', 'MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv']	['enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay']	PMC1665650.nxml
13652	Similarly, antibodies directed against MMTV were absent in 70% of the Mtv-null animals, despite use of a more sensitive assay as compared to previous reports [39].	[[39, 43], [70, 73]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13653	To test the specificity of the sporadically occurring, low-titer antibodies, Western blots of purified MMTV were incubated with sera from individual Mtv-negative animals infected by milk-borne MMTV (Figure 4B).	[[103, 107], [193, 197], [149, 152]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13654	Since only a small percentage of the resistant animals developed antibodies and the antibodies were not directed against surface antigens, the resistance of Mtv-null mice to MMTV-induced mammary tumors is not due to production of neutralizing antibodies.	[[174, 178], [157, 160]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13655	Therefore, the mechanism of viral resistance in Mtv-null mice does not resemble antibody-mediated mechanism(s) reported for other mouse strains that limit MMTV infection [38,39]..	[[155, 159], [48, 51]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13656	The resistance of Mtv-null mice to MMTV infection may result from a cell-mediated immune response to the virus.	[[35, 39], [18, 21]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13657	To test this idea, weanling BALB/c and Mtv-null animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with 5 × 106 A20 cells (a BALB/c B-cell lymphoma cell line) [40].	[[39, 42]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13658	A second set of mice was injected with the same number of A20 cells stably transfected with an infectious MMTV provirus, HYB-MTV.	[[106, 110]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13659	Injection of A20 cells gave approximately the same percentage of solid, peritoneal tumors in both BALB/c and Mtv-null mice (25% [3/12] with an average latency of 7.5 ± 1.5 wk versus 29% [4/14] with an average latency of 6.8 ± 2.3 wk).	[[109, 112]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13660	In contrast, 38% (5/13) of BALB/c (average latency 5.2 ± 0.5 wk), but none of the Mtv-null mice developed tumors when injected with MMTV-transfected A20 cells.	[[132, 136], [82, 85]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13661	Therefore, these results suggest that Mtv-null mice can direct a specific immune response against C3H MMTV-infected cells..	[[102, 106], [38, 41]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13662	Since the resistance of Mtv-null mice to TBLV and MMTV infection may be due to an immune response, we tested whether these mice may also have an altered disease susceptibility to other pathogens.	[[50, 54], [24, 27], [41, 45]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13663	BALB/c and Mtv-null mice were inoculated intragastrically with V.	[[11, 14]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13664	Mid-log phase bacterial suspensions containing 105, 106, or 107 colony-forming units (CFUs) were fed to 5- to 6-d-old pups, and mortality was recorded over a 48-h period.	[[86, 89]]	[[64, 83]]	['CFU']	['colony-forming unit']	PMC1665650.nxml
13665	As anticipated, the average lethal dose (LD50) of V.	[[41, 45]]	[]	['LD50']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13666	cholerae in BALB/c mice was 1.6 × 105 CFUs (Table 2).	[[38, 41]]	[]	['CFU']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13667	In contrast, the average LD50 of V.	[[25, 29]]	[]	['LD50']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13668	cholerae in Mtv-null animals was ∼16-fold higher (2.3 × 106 CFUs) (p < 0.05).	[[60, 63], [12, 15]]	[]	['CFU', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml

13681	Several mechanisms of resistance to MMTV infection have previously been described.	[[36, 40]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13682	A number of these mechanisms involves disruption of Sag-induced interactions of B and T cells, which are required for amplification of the number of milk-borne MMTV-infected cells and transmission of virus to the mammary gland [6,7,18].	[[160, 164], [52, 55]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13683	Transgenic mice expressing high levels of C3H MMTV Sag delete their Sag-reactive T cells and are refractory to milk-borne C3H MMTV infection [6].	[[46, 50], [126, 130], [51, 54], [68, 71]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV', 'Sag', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13684	A similar phenotype has been reported in Vβ8.2-transgenic mice, which cannot be infected by SW MMTV whose Sag does not recognize Vβ8.2+ T cells [7].	[[95, 99], [106, 109]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13685	B-cell-deficient mice are resistant to milk-borne MMTV infection as demonstrated by their failure to delete Sag-reactive T cells and the absence of proviral integrations in spleen and mammary glands [18].	[[50, 54], [108, 111]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13686	Further, mice with inefficient presentation of MMTV Sag due to MHC class II mutations are resistant to viral infection [42].	[[47, 51], [52, 55]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13687	Knockout mice deficient in cell surface molecules necessary for T-B cell interactions (CD28/CTLA4-B7 or CD40/CD40L) also demonstrate defects in milk-borne MMTV dissemination and transmission [16,19,20].	[[155, 159]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13688	Thus, the resistance of Mtv-null mice to MMTV-induced tumorigenesis might be attributed to lack of Sag-mediated viral amplification in the lymphoid compartment..	[[41, 45], [24, 27], [99, 102]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13689	Two lines of evidence argue against a defect in Sag-mediated amplification in Mtv-null animals.	[[78, 81], [48, 51]]	[]	['Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13690	First, these mice are resistant to TBLV-induced lymphomas (Table 1).	[[35, 39]]	[]	['TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13691	TBLV encodes a truncated Sag protein that lacks the C-terminal domain necessary for interaction with the Vβ region of the TCR and does not induce Sag-mediated deletion after infection, yet induces T-cell lymphomas in susceptible BALB/c mice [34,43].	[[25, 28], [146, 149], [122, 125], [105, 107]]	[]	['Sag', 'Sag', 'TCR', 'Vβ']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13692	Second, Mtv-null animals are resistant to tumorigenesis by the TBLV sag-frameshift virus (unpublished data).	[[8, 11], [63, 67]]	[]	['Mtv', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13693	Published results indicate TBLV variants engineered with a double-frameshift mutation in the truncated sag gene induced lymphomas with the same efficiency as wild-type TBLV [34].	[[27, 31], [168, 172]]	[]	['TBLV', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13694	Failure of TBLV or TBLV sag frameshift viruses to induce tumors in Mtv-null mice suggests that resistance is linked to a host immune response at a step upstream of the Sag response, but common to both MMTV and TBLV infections..	[[201, 205], [67, 70], [168, 171], [11, 15], [19, 23], [210, 214]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag', 'TBLV', 'TBLV', 'TBLV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13695	Production of a neutralizing antibody response has been shown to prevent induction of MMTV-induced mammary tumors [38,39].	[[86, 90]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13696	The I/LnJ mouse strain, which contains endogenous Mtvs, produces IgG2a MMTV-specific neutralizing antibodies that block viral transmission from lymphoid to mammary gland cells.	[[71, 75], [50, 53]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13697	Unlike the MMTV-susceptible BALB/c strain, production of antibodies in this strain is sustained and dependent on interferon γ [39].	[[11, 15]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13698	Experiments in BALB.D2 mice, which lack endogenous Mtvs, have also shown that a neutralizing antibody response does not dramatically interfere with viral amplification in lymphoid cells, but limited infection of the mammary gland [38].	[[51, 54]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13699	In contrast, the BALB/Mtv-null mice show only low level, sporadic infection of lymphoid organs, and no transmission is demonstrable to progeny.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13700	I/LnJ and BALB.D2 mice both showed a significant MMTV Sag response following infection [38,39], whereas BALB/Mtv-null animals did not.	[[49, 53], [109, 112], [54, 57]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13701	Further, the BALB.D2 results were obtained with SW MMTV, which is known to induce a strong Sag response in adult mice, but causes mammary tumors at a low incidence [38].	[[51, 55], [91, 94]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13702	Therefore, Mtv-null mice appear to demonstrate a unique genetic mechanism of resistance to MMTV..	[[91, 95], [11, 14]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13703	Previous reports from the Benjamin lab indicated that endogenous Mtv7 Sag-mediated deletion of TCR Vβ6+ cells renders mice susceptible to polyomavirus-induced tumors [27,44].	[[70, 73], [95, 98]]	[]	['Sag', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13704	This observation resulted from the absence of a TCR Vβ6+ population of polyoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).	[[113, 116], [48, 51]]	[]	['CTL', 'TCR']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13705	In contrast, our studies show that any one of three BALB/c endogenous MMTVs with different Sag specificities was necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to completely disparate pathogens.	[[70, 74], [91, 94]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13706	Since the resistance to both MMTV and V.	[[29, 33]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13707	cholerae), it is unlikely that Sag-mediated removal of CTLs is the primary reason for susceptibility to infection in the presence of endogenous MMTVs.	[[55, 58], [144, 148], [31, 34]]	[]	['CTL', 'MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13708	Our results also raise interesting questions regarding the evolution and maintenance of endogenous Mtvs in mouse populations.	[[99, 102]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13709	The dynamic compromise for mutual survival of both MMTV and the mouse will be influenced by complex interactions between the MMTV-modulated murine immune system and numerous environmental pathogens..	[[51, 55], [125, 129]]	[]	['MMTV', 'MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13710	Although the exact process leading to MMTV disease susceptibility in BALB/Mtv-null animals remains to be determined, several clues are available.	[[38, 42], [74, 77]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13711	An enhanced immune response to MMTV-encoded proteins was observed in Mtv-null mice, consistent with proposals that there is immunological intolerance to viral antigens in the absence of endogenous proviruses [38].	[[31, 35], [69, 72]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13712	However, Mtv-null mice were resistant to both MMTV and V.	[[46, 50], [9, 12]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13713	cholerae, which share few, if any, antigenic determinants, and virus infection could be detected in Mtv-null organs, even as long as 15 mo post-infection.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13714	Further, susceptibility of mice to MMTV and V.	[[35, 39]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13715	cholerae was reconstituted by any one of three endogenous Mtv proviruses, Mtv6, Mtv8, or Mtv9.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13716	One of these proviruses, Mtv6, lacks >6 kb of sequence encoding most of gag and env, as well as the entire pol gene [45], thus eliminating most of the immunodominant CTL epitopes [46].	[[166, 169]]	[]	['CTL']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13717	These results suggest that (i) an MMTV-encoded gene product confers susceptibility to two disparate pathogens, and (ii) the viral product is not encoded by the gag, pol, or env genes..	[[34, 38]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13718	The Mtv6 provirus is believed to encode only a single mRNA, which has been functionally shown to encode Sag [47], and our data are consistent with these observations (unpublished data).	[[104, 107]]	[]	['Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13719	cholerae very early after infection, we suggest that MMTV Sag acts as a negative regulator of innate or intrinsic immunity.	[[53, 57], [58, 61]]	[]	['MMTV', 'Sag']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13720	Failure to suppress innate immunity would explain early effects on bacterial and viral loads in Mtv-null animals, as well as their heightened ability to use the adaptive CTL response to reject C3H MMTV-expressing tumor cells.	[[170, 173], [197, 201], [96, 99]]	[]	['CTL', 'MMTV', 'Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml

13722	cholerae, as well as the MMTV envelope protein, SU, both bind to TLR4 to stimulate an immune response [26,48].	[[25, 29]]	[]	['MMTV']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml
13723	Although bacterial superantigens of Gram-positive bacteria appear to increase TLR4 mRNA and protein levels [50], our preliminary experiments have detected no differences in the surface TLR4 expression of BALB/c and BALB/Mtv-null macrophages.	[[220, 223]]	[]	['Mtv']	[]	PMC1665650.nxml

13773	These mismatches are evidently a consequence of the evolutionary plasticity of the HA gene: rather than experiencing a constant rate of antigenic change, HA evolution is characterized by sporadic jumps in antigenic space, generating new antigenic clusters that mismatch the vaccine in use [12].

13776	Our phylogenetic analysis revealed substantial genetic diversity in the NA and HA genes within each epidemic season, exemplified by multiple cocirculating clades containing viral isolates both from within New York State and other locations worldwide (Figures 1 and 2; phylogenetic trees for the NA, HA, and concatenated internal without colour labeling are shown in Figures S2, S3, and S4, respectively).

13780	The existence of fewer HA clades most likely reflects a lack of background isolates in HA compared to NA, the fact that HA undergoes more frequent reassortment, and/or the action of periodic immune selection..

13781	The NA phylogeny shows at least three separate introductions of viral isolates into New York State during the 1997–1998 season, six in 1998–1999, four in 1999–2000, three in 2001–2002, five in 2002–2003, five in 2003–2004, and one during the 2004–2005 season (Figure 1).

13782	To further explore the genesis of intraseasonal genetic diversity, we estimated rates of nucleotide substitution and the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the HA, NA, and concatenated internal genes (Table 1).

13783	Substitution rates estimated using a relaxed molecular clock to account for lineage-specific rate variation fell within the range typical of RNA viruses [16]: 3.53–7.38, 3.11–12.50, and 2.78–6.54 × 10−3 nucleotide substitutions per site, per year for the HA, NA, and concatenated internal genes, respectively.

13784	Mean MRCA ages ranged from 0.77 to 8.66 y for the HA gene, from 0.95 to 4.06 y for the NA gene, and from 0.83 to 3.17 y for the concatenated internal genes (Table 1).	[[50, 52], [5, 9], [87, 89]]	[]	['HA', 'MRCA', 'NA']	[]	PMC1665651.nxml
13785	Given that each influenza season lasted from 15 to 28 wk, such relatively old MRCA values reveal that the ancestors of the influenza virus population in any season existed several months—or even years—prior to the start of that season, further indicating that isolates had already diversified before being imported into New York..

13788	For the New York State isolates sampled from all seasons, we examined the site-specific numbers of nonsynonymous (dN) versus synonymous (dS) substitutions, with dN > dS indicative of position selection.

13791	Of these, five acquired a new HA gene, two a new NA gene, and three both new HA and NA genes through double reassortment, while a single isolate acquired one or more of the six internal genes.	[[30, 32], [77, 79], [49, 51], [84, 86]]	[]	['HA', 'HA', 'NA', 'NA']	[]	PMC1665651.nxml

13793	Notably, multiple clades on the NA and internal gene trees tended to combine into a single clade on the HA tree (such as A/New York/332/1999), suggesting that longer-term antigenic drift may favor these HA clades..	[[104, 106], [203, 205], [32, 34]]	[]	['HA', 'HA', 'NA']	[]	PMC1665651.nxml

13797	To place the New York State viruses in a global context, 48 unique HA gene sequences and 140 unique NA gene sequences from other human and swine influenza A viruses sampled worldwide from 1997–2005 were compiled from GenBank to make total datasets of 466 and 553 sequences for the HA and NA, respectively (Tables S2 and S3)..

13809	We found that Vpr-induced apoptosis was unaffected by knockdown of ANT.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13810	In support of the idea that checkpoint activation and apoptosis induction are functionally linked, we show that Bax activation by Vpr was ablated when ATR or GADD45α was knocked down.	[[151, 154], [158, 165], [130, 133]]	[]	['ATR', 'GADD45α', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13811	Certain mutants of Vpr, such as R77Q and I74A, identified in long-term nonprogressors, have been proposed to inefficiently induce apoptosis while activating the G2 checkpoint in a normal manner.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml

13816	The HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) has emerged as a major proapoptotic gene product (reviewed in [8,9]).	[[4, 9], [27, 30]]	[]	['HIV-1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13817	In an effort to characterize the apoptotic signaling cascade induced by Vpr downstream of the mitochondria, Muthumani et al.	[[72, 75]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13818	[10,11] demonstrated that Vpr induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway.	[[26, 29]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13819	We, and others, have previously shown that Vpr causes activation of the G2 checkpoint protein, ATR (ataxia and telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 related), a serine/threonine kinase responsive to DNA damage and replication stress [12–14].	[[95, 98], [43, 46]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13820	Furthermore, activation of ATR by Vpr is required for Vpr-induced G2 arrest and involves the ATR-associated molecules Rad17 and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 trimer [14–16]..	[[27, 30], [93, 96], [34, 37], [54, 57]]	[]	['ATR', 'ATR', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13821	A cause–effect relationship between the two deleterious actions of Vpr (G2 arrest and apoptosis) has not been established.	[[67, 70]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13822	For example, treatment of cells with either caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR/ATM checkpoint function, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to ATR, relieves both Vpr-induced G2 arrest and apoptosis [17,18].	[[74, 77], [144, 147], [125, 130], [163, 166]]	[]	['ATM', 'ATR', 'siRNA', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13823	[19,20] demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of Wee1, a Cdk1 inhibitor that is activated by DNA damage, abrogated both Vpr-induced G2 arrest and apoptosis.	[[26, 31], [116, 119]]	[]	['siRNA', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13824	Taken together, these data suggest a model in which checkpoint activation and apoptosis signaling by Vpr are functionally associated and that such an association stems from the ability of Vpr to activate ATR [12–14,17]..	[[204, 207], [101, 104], [188, 191]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13825	Thus, mutants of Vpr have been described that induce normal levels of G2 arrest but are partially impaired for induction of apoptosis [21,22].	[[17, 20]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13826	One model to explain the proapoptotic activity of Vpr was proposed by Jacotot et al.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13827	[24], who observed that recombinant Vpr associates with the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) on purified mitochondria, to directly promote release of mitochondrion-associated cytochrome c and apoptosis.	[[92, 95], [36, 39]]	[[60, 90]]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	['adenine nucleotide transporter']	PMC1665652.nxml
13828	This finding suggested that Vpr initiated the commitment to apoptosis at the mitochondrial membrane by binding to ANT, rather than by activating upstream stress signaling pathways derived from checkpoint activation..	[[114, 117], [28, 31]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13829	We find that entry into G2 is a requirement for Vpr to induce apoptosis.	[[48, 51]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13830	Since the requirement for entry into G2 seemed inconsistent with the reported ability of Vpr to bind to ANT and promote apoptosis in a cell cycle–independent manner, we then examined the requirement for ANT.	[[104, 107], [89, 92]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13831	We find that Vpr-induced apoptosis is unaffected by knockdown of ANT.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13832	Instead, Vpr-induced apoptosis is dependent on the presence of Bax and is concomitant with Bax activation.	[[9, 12]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13833	Furthermore, Bax activation is a result of proapoptotic signals transduced by Vpr through the upstream stress proteins ATR and GADD45α (growth arrest and DNA damage–responsive protein α) because knockdown of ATR or GADD45α prevented activation of Bax.	[[119, 122], [208, 211], [127, 134], [215, 222], [78, 81]]	[]	['ATR', 'ATR', 'GADD45α', 'GADD45α', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13834	We also demonstrate that, despite the striking similarities between the signaling events induced by Vpr and those induced by genotoxic stress, important differences can be found.	[[100, 103]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13835	Specifically, Vpr-induced apoptosis is abrogated by checkpoint inhibition, while apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents is exacerbated by checkpoint inhibition.	[[14, 17]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13836	Taken together, these results demonstrate that Vpr activates the ATR-initiated DNA damage–signaling pathway to link checkpoint activation and commitment to apoptosis..	[[65, 68], [47, 50]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13837	Treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR and ATM, or siRNA targeted to ATR, abrogates Vpr-induced G2 arrest and apoptosis [14,17,18].	[[49, 52], [41, 44], [75, 78], [57, 62], [90, 93]]	[]	['ATM', 'ATR', 'ATR', 'siRNA', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13838	One possible explanation for these observations would be that Vpr induces apoptosis as a downstream consequence of sustained G2 checkpoint activation.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13839	This idea, however, is inconsistent with a previously published model in which Vpr was proposed to directly bind to the mitochondrial ANT to cause release of proapoptotic factors in a cell cycle–independent manner [23,24]..	[[134, 137], [79, 82]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13840	However, if Vpr were binding ANT to induce apoptosis, we would predict that commitment to apoptosis should be independent of cell cycle status and would occur early following expression of Vpr.	[[29, 32], [12, 15]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13841	We transduced a human CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell line, SupT1, with lentiviral vectors (pHR-VPR-G or pHR-VPR-R) expressing Vpr and either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), respectively, with an intervening internal ribosome entry site (Figure 1A).

13848	Therefore, induction of G2 arrest is an early Vpr-mediated event, whereas release of Smac and caspase activation lag in relation to cell cycle arrest by approximately 24 h.	[[85, 89], [46, 49]]	[]	['Smac', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13849	Since G2 arrest clearly precedes apoptosis, we found it compelling to ask whether transition into G2 was required for the commitment to apoptosis in Vpr-expressing cells..	[[149, 152]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13850	We designed an experiment to prevent Vpr-expressing cells from entering G2 and then asked whether these cells would still be susceptible to Vpr-induced apoptosis.	[[37, 40], [140, 143]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13851	HeLa cells represent an appropriate cell type to study Vpr-induced apoptosis, because ATR activation, breast cancer–associated protein 1 (BRCA1) phosphorylation, and GADD45α upregulation are conserved from HeLa cells to primary human CD4+ lymphocytes [14,17,26,29].

13852	The comparatively high number of cells in G2/M in the synchronized, pHR-VPR–infected culture (17%) reflects cells that reached G2/M prior to synchronization and arrested due to Vpr expression.	[[177, 180]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13853	To evaluate the frequency of apoptotic cells in these cultures, cells were stained with the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI).	[[151, 155]]	[[104, 149]]	['DAPI']	['4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride']	PMC1665652.nxml
13854	We have previously described the use of DAPI for analysis of Vpr-induced apoptosis [17,30].	[[40, 44], [61, 64]]	[]	['DAPI', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13855	DAPI staining revealed that at 48 h post-transduction, 23% of cells transduced with Vpr were apoptotic if allowed to cycle, whereas only 7% were apoptotic if treated with thymidine (Figure 2C).	[[84, 87]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13856	To address whether the decreased sensitivity of G1/S-arrested cells to Vpr-induced apoptosis could be due to thymidine treatment itself, cells were treated with a pharmacologic apoptosis inducer (etoposide or staurosporine) and then allowed to cycle, or not (thymidine incubation).	[[71, 74]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13857	Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and an inducer of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and, like Vpr, causes G2 arrest [31,32].	[[82, 85], [98, 101]]	[[60, 79]]	['DSB', 'Vpr']	['double-strand break']	PMC1665652.nxml
13858	To confirm the previous apoptosis results, we performed parallel experiments using pHR-VPR-R and staining for caspase activity with FITC-VAD-FMK (Figure 2D) and by measuring poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage (Figure 2E).	[[202, 206]]	[]	['PARP']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13859	Analysis of Vpr expression by Western blot revealed that thymidine treatment did not affect expression of Vpr (Figure 2F).	[[12, 15], [106, 109]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13860	These results are in agreement with those obtained by DAPI staining and confirm that synchronization of cells in G1/S alleviates Vpr-induced apoptosis..	[[54, 58], [129, 132]]	[]	['DAPI', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13861	The previous results indicate that the proapoptotic effect of Vpr is lost when cells are artificially maintained in G1/S.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13862	To determine whether induction of apoptosis by Vpr specifically requires transition into G2, cells were synchronized as in the previous experiment and then were released from thymidine block and allowed to reenter the cell cycle.	[[47, 50]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13863	Both mock-treated and Vpr-expressing cells entered G2 at 12 h postrelease.	[[22, 25]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13864	Mock-infected cells completed the first division cycle at 18 h postrelease and continued to cycle (Figure 3A, upper panels), while cells expressing Vpr persisted in G2 for the remainder of the experiment (Figure 3A, lower panels).	[[148, 151]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13865	A small amount of cells (17.4%) in the Vpr-transduced culture reached G1 at 18 h postrelease.	[[39, 42]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13866	We then asked when, after release from the thymidine block, Vpr-expressing cells would enter apoptosis.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13867	Cells which were synchronized, maintained in G1 for 48 h, and then released (Figure 3B, lanes 2–6) began to display detectable PARP cleavage by 12 h postrelease (Figure 3B, lane 3).	[[127, 131]]	[]	['PARP']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13868	Therefore, the onset of apoptosis in Vpr-expressing cells is concomitant with entry into the G2 phase.	[[37, 40]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13869	In the absence of synchronization in G1 (Figure 3B, lanes 7–11), Vpr-expressing cells begin to display PARP cleavage by 24 h post-transduction.	[[103, 107], [65, 68]]	[]	['PARP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13870	Synchronized cells, in the absence of Vpr expression, did not display PARP cleavage after release (unpublished data)..	[[70, 74], [38, 41]]	[]	['PARP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13871	Parallel samples from the previous synchronization experiment were also analyzed by DAPI staining (Figure 3C).	[[84, 88]]	[]	['DAPI']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13872	These experiments revealed chromatin fragmentation/condensation in Vpr-expressing cells at 24 and 48 h postrelease (Figure 3C)..	[[67, 70]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13873	Taken together, these data indicate that Vpr-induced apoptosis requires entry into the G2 phase and artificially maintaining cells in G1 effectively prevents the onset of apoptosis..	[[41, 44]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13874	Due to the phenotypic similarities between Vpr and genotoxic stress, many studies on Vpr have been modeled based on the current understanding of DNA damage signaling [12,14,33].	[[43, 46], [85, 88]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13875	Thus, we set out to compare in parallel the effect of ATR suppression on Vpr- versus genotoxin-induced apoptosis.	[[54, 57], [73, 76]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13876	We reasoned that if Vpr causes irreparable DNA damage, then the effect of checkpoint overriding on Vpr-induced apoptosis should mirror that of cells treated with genotoxic agents.	[[20, 23], [99, 102]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13877	To test this, we treated cells with siRNAs specific to ATR, ATM, or nonspecific siRNA.	[[60, 63], [55, 58], [36, 41]]	[]	['ATM', 'ATR', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13878	At 48 h following siRNA transfection, we treated cells with 25 μM N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), an SN1-type methylating agent and inducer of G2 arrest, or 25 μM etoposide.	[[104, 108], [18, 23]]	[]	['MNNG', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13879	At 24- and 48-h time points following the addition of etoposide or MNNG, we measured caspase activation (Figure 4A and 4B; for simplicity, only one time point is shown in 4A).	[[67, 71]]	[]	['MNNG']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13880	Knockdown of ATR dramatically exacerbated etoposide- and MNNG-induced apoptosis (14.5% to 60.7% and 6.2% to 35.4%, respectively, at 48 h).	[[13, 16], [57, 61]]	[]	['ATR', 'MNNG']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13881	Knockdown of ATM led to a modest increase in genotoxin-induced apoptosis (14.5% to 21.3% for etoposide and 6.2% to 10% for MNNG, at 48 h).	[[13, 16], [123, 127]]	[]	['ATM', 'MNNG']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13882	In contrast, Vpr-induced caspase activation was dramatically inhibited by ATR knockdown (from 41.2% to 14.2%) but was unaffected by ATM knockdown (41.2% to 39.4%).	[[132, 135], [74, 77], [13, 16]]	[]	['ATM', 'ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13883	DAPI staining showed a similar ATR-dependent decrease in Vpr-induced apoptosis (Figure 4C).	[[31, 34], [57, 60]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13884	The level of knockdown achieved by each siRNA was determined by Western blot with antibodies specific for the endogenous proteins (Figure 4D)..	[[40, 45]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13885	In conclusion, we demonstrated the requirement for ATR checkpoint activation through two different methodologies: (a) manipulation by G1/S synchronization and (b) ATR knockdown.	[[51, 54], [163, 166]]	[]	['ATR', 'ATR']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13886	We also conclude that this aspect of Vpr function represents a departure from the manner in which checkpoint activation relates to apoptosis in the context of genotoxic agents..	[[37, 40]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13887	Early reports suggested that the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), which consists of VDAC, ANT, and cyclophilin D, was involved in release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria in response to various apoptotic stimuli (reviewed in [38]) and, in particular, for Vpr [23].	[[102, 105], [71, 75], [96, 100], [277, 280]]	[[33, 69]]	['ANT', 'PTPC', 'VDAC', 'Vpr']	['permeability transition pore complex']	PMC1665652.nxml
13888	However, later reports have put in question the role of the PTPC in DNA damage–induced apoptosis [39–42].	[[60, 64]]	[]	['PTPC']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13889	For example, mouse cells deficient in ANT are fully capable of undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage and, instead, show increased resistance to necrosis in response to high intracellular Ca2+ [39].	[[38, 41]]	[]	['ANT']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13890	Mouse cells deficient in cyclophilin D, which is required for VDAC function, are fully capable of undergoing apoptosis in response to genotoxins [40,42].	[[62, 66]]	[]	['VDAC']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13891	Large oligomeric complexes containing Bax and possessing apoptotic pore function do not contain ANT or VDAC [43].	[[96, 99], [103, 107]]	[]	['ANT', 'VDAC']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13892	Bax is required for activation of the mitochondrial pore-forming complex that responds to DNA damage (reviewed in [44,45]) and the pore-forming function of Bax is independent of ANT or VDAC [43,46–48]..	[[178, 181], [185, 189]]	[]	['ANT', 'VDAC']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13893	Thus, we asked whether Vpr-induced apoptosis is mediated through ANT or, alternatively, through Bax.	[[65, 68], [23, 26]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13894	We addressed this question using siRNAs that would specifically downregulate Bax or ANT, in the context of pHR-VPR-R transduction.	[[84, 87], [33, 38]]	[]	['ANT', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13895	Bax knockdown led to a dramatic decrease in Vpr-induced apoptosis (from 41.2% in the presence of nonspecific siRNA to 12.6% in the presence of Bax siRNA; Figure 4A), whereas ANT knockdown had no appreciable effect on apoptosis (41.2% versus 39.5%; Figure 4A).

13896	These results were also confirmed by analysis of DAPI-stained nuclei (Figure 4C).	[[49, 53]]	[]	['DAPI']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13897	The levels of knockdown achieved by each siRNA are shown in Figure 4D..	[[41, 46]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13898	To probe for Bax activation in the presence of Vpr, peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes were infected with either DHIV3 or DHIV3-ΔVPR, cells were lysed, and immunoreactivity with Bax6A7 antibody was tested by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot (Figure 4E).	[[47, 50]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13899	Our previous studies established that Vpr-induced ATR activation leads to BRCA1 phosphorylation and GADD45α upregulation and that both ATR and GADD45α are required for Vpr-induced apoptosis [14,17].	[[50, 53], [135, 138], [74, 79], [100, 107], [143, 150], [38, 41], [168, 171]]	[]	['ATR', 'ATR', 'BRCA1', 'GADD45α', 'GADD45α', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13900	Based on previous findings and data reported here, we propose that ATR activation is an upstream signaling event in the pathway leading to Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	[[67, 70], [139, 142]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13901	If this were correct, then it would follow that Bax activation by Vpr is also ATR dependent.	[[78, 81], [66, 69]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13902	In order to examine the requirement of ATR in Vpr-induced Bax activation, we treated cells with siRNAs specific to either ATR or GADD45α prior to transduction with pHR-VPR-R.	[[39, 42], [122, 125], [129, 136], [96, 101], [46, 49]]	[]	['ATR', 'ATR', 'GADD45α', 'siRNA', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13903	We observed that the increase in Bax6A7 reactivity was reduced to basal levels in the presence of either ATR or GADD45α knockdown but not when using a nonspecific siRNA (Figure 4F).	[[105, 108], [112, 119], [163, 168]]	[]	['ATR', 'GADD45α', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13904	Therefore, these results provide additional support for a model in which Bax activation is a principal effector of Vpr-induced apoptosis downstream of G2 checkpoint activation by the ATR kinase..	[[183, 186], [115, 118]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13905	It is unclear whether cells arrested in G2 by Vpr transition into mitosis.	[[46, 49]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13906	Early measurements of the mitotic index suggested that Vpr induced G2 arrest and concomitantly inhibited entry into mitosis [50–53].	[[55, 58]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13907	Later studies, however, showed that cells expressing Vpr develop mitotic abnormalities such as multipolar spindles, mislocalization of certain spindle pole body proteins, and defects in cytokinesis [54,55], collectively indicating mitotic entry.	[[53, 56]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13908	To reexamine the issue of mitotic entry in the context of Vpr, we measured phosphorylation of histone 3 (H3) at serine-10 [56,57] in the presence of Vpr (Figure 5).	[[58, 61], [149, 152]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13909	Therefore, Vpr expression leads to mitotic entry in HeLa cells following G2 arrest, whereas Vpr causes sustained G2 arrest in SupT1 cells without subsequent mitotic entry..	[[11, 14], [92, 95]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13910	Several natural or laboratory-constructed mutants of HIV-1 Vpr have been reported that selectively ablate either G2 arrest or apoptosis.	[[53, 58], [59, 62]]	[]	['HIV-1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13911	The second group includes Vpr-GFP and GFP-Vpr fusion proteins.	[[30, 33], [38, 41], [26, 29], [42, 45]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13912	In particular, it was reported that while a GFP-Vpr (whereby Vpr is carboxyl-terminal to GFP) fusion protein was inactive in both G2 arrest and apoptosis induction, the reciprocal chimera, Vpr-GFP, was able to induce apoptosis in the absence of G2 arrest [59].	[[44, 47], [89, 92], [193, 196], [48, 51], [61, 64], [189, 192]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'GFP', 'Vpr', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13913	The Vpr mutants, R77Q and I74A, were separately constructed in the background of pHR-VPR-R (which encodes HIV-1NL4–3 vpr).	[[4, 7]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13914	The levels of apoptosis, as judged by staining with FITC-VAD-FMK, were very similar between wild-type Vpr, Vpr(R77Q), and Vpr(I74A) and the levels of G2 arrest were also similar.	[[102, 105]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13915	To more directly assess whether the frequencies of G2 arrest and apoptosis correlated with each other, we calculated the ratio of cells in apoptosis over cells in G2 for each mutant Vpr (% apoptotic cells/% cells in G2/M [Apo/G2M]).	[[182, 185]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13916	If a Vpr mutant induces normal levels of G2 arrest, but reduced levels of apoptosis, then the Apo/G2M ratio should decrease.	[[5, 8]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13917	The Apo/G2M ratios were 0.83 for wild-type Vpr, 0.91 for Vpr(R77Q), and 0.92 for Vpr(I74A).	[[43, 46]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13918	Therefore, we conclude that neither of the Vpr mutants tested here resulted in lower levels of apoptosis induction, when compared to wild-type Vpr..	[[43, 46], [143, 146]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13919	We previously demonstrated that Vpr induced phosphorylation BRCA1 at residue Ser1423 by the ATR kinase and that this phosphorylation correlated with induction of apoptosis [17].	[[92, 95], [60, 65], [32, 35]]	[]	['ATR', 'BRCA1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13920	To examine whether the Vpr mutants had a normal ability to induce BRCA1 phosphorylation, we performed Western blot on lysates from cells infected with the above lentiviral vectors.	[[66, 71], [23, 26]]	[]	['BRCA1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13921	Wild-type Vpr and mutants were able to induce BRCA1 phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation was, in all three cases, ablated by treatment with caffeine (Figure 6B).	[[46, 51], [10, 13]]	[]	['BRCA1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13922	We then examined the phenotype of a Vpr-GFP fusion protein.	[[40, 43], [36, 39]]	[]	['GFP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13923	It is well known that the addition of recombinant amino acid sequences as small as the influenza hemagglutinin tag at the carboxyl terminus of Vpr results in failure of Vpr to activate the G2 checkpoint [25].	[[143, 146], [169, 172]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13924	Carboxyl-terminal addition of larger fusion partners, such as luciferase [25] or GFP [59], also results in ablation of the G2 arrest.	[[81, 84]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13925	[59] found that carboxyl-terminal addition of GFP resulted in a Vpr chimera that was fully able to induce apoptosis.	[[46, 49], [64, 67]]	[]	['GFP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13926	We constructed a Vpr-GFP chimera and observed that it was, as expected, unable to induce G2 arrest (unpublished data).	[[21, 24], [17, 20]]	[]	['GFP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13927	To generate an appropriate control, we introduced the R80A mutation in the fusion construct, to generate Vpr(R80A)-GFP, and tested its ability to induce apoptosis (Figure 6C).	[[115, 118]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13928	Both Vpr-GFP and Vpr(R80A)-GFP were able to induce apoptosis.	[[9, 12], [27, 30], [5, 8]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13929	Since Vpr(R80A) that is not fused to GFP is unable to induce apoptosis (Figures 1 and 2), we expected that the introduction of the R80A substitution in the Vpr-GFP fusion protein [Vpr(R80A)-GFP] would also result in a protein devoid of apoptosis induction.	[[37, 40], [160, 163], [156, 159]]	[]	['GFP', 'GFP', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13930	Surprisingly, Vpr(R80A)-GFP is also capable of inducing apoptosis.	[[24, 27]]	[]	['GFP']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13931	Because the fusion with carboxyl-terminal GFP turns Vpr(R80A), a nonproaptotic protein, into an apoptotic one, it appears that the induction of apoptosis by Vpr-GFP represents a gain-of-function phenotype and is not representative of the biology of wild-type Vpr..

13932	In conclusion, our results suggest that induction of G2 arrest and apoptosis by HIV-1 Vpr are functionally interrelated and not genetically separable..	[[80, 85], [86, 89]]	[]	['HIV-1', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13933	One gap in our current understanding of checkpoint signaling and apoptosis lies between the activation of nuclear checkpoint sentinels, such as ATR and ATM, and the involvement of Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators at the mitochondria.	[[152, 155], [144, 147]]	[]	['ATM', 'ATR']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13934	However, loss of p53 does not abrogate induction of apoptosis by Vpr [30,64], and we have been unable to observe Rad9 or histone H1 translocation to the mitochondria in response to Vpr (J.	[[65, 68], [181, 184]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13935	These observations, taken together with the results presented here, indicate that Vpr links checkpoint activation and apoptosis in a novel manner and that a key element is the requirement for entry into G2 (Figure 7A)..	[[82, 85]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13936	In support of a cause–effect relationship between Vpr-induced G2 arrest and apoptosis, several reports demonstrate that the apoptotic effect of Vpr can be overridden by suppressing G2-specific cell cycle–regulating kinases [17–20].	[[50, 53], [144, 147]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13937	[19,20] showed that suppression of Wee1 in the presence of Vpr abrogated both Vpr-induced G2 arrest and apoptosis..	[[59, 62], [78, 81]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13938	We also demonstrate that ATR knockdown exacerbates genotoxin-induced apoptosis but, surprisingly, relieves Vpr-induced apoptosis [17].	[[25, 28], [107, 110]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13939	The different effects of ATR knockdown on Vpr- versus genotoxin-induced apoptosis suggest that Vpr activity fundamentally differs from genotoxic stress.	[[25, 28], [42, 45], [95, 98]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13940	More specifically, it is tempting to speculate that such a difference resides in the fact that Vpr does not cause physical DNA damage (such as DSBs) whereas genotoxic agents do.	[[143, 146], [95, 98]]	[]	['DSB', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13941	In fact, three lines of evidence indicate that Vpr activates ATR in a manner that does not involve generation of DSBs: (1) Pulse-field gel electrophoresis revealed no DSBs in vpr-expressing cells [12].	[[61, 64], [113, 116], [167, 170], [47, 50]]	[]	['ATR', 'DSB', 'DSB', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13942	(2) Vpr fails to induce phosphorylation of ATM at serine-1981, a residue linked to DSB signaling and potently phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation [12].	[[43, 46], [83, 86], [4, 7]]	[]	['ATM', 'DSB', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13943	(3) And, as we have shown here, in contrast with etoposide-induced apoptosis, Vpr-induced apoptosis is relieved under conditions of checkpoint suppression..	[[78, 81]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13944	Models for Vpr activity that would be in agreement with the lack of DSB formation by Vpr have been proposed in the past.	[[68, 71], [11, 14], [85, 88]]	[]	['DSB', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13945	For example, Vpr may perturb nuclear envelope integrity, as suggested by de Noronha et al.	[[13, 16]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13946	Perturbation of nuclear envelope integrity may, in turn, lead to ATR activation.	[[65, 68]]	[]	['ATR']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13947	proposed that Vpr binds directly to chromatin in a manner that results in ATR activation [12]..	[[74, 77], [14, 17]]	[]	['ATR', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13948	Previous reports have suggested that Vpr induces apoptosis via a direct interaction with ANT at the inner mitochondrial membrane, which results in release of cytochrome c from fractionated mitochondria [23].	[[89, 92], [37, 40]]	[]	['ANT', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13949	These observations would indicate that Vpr induces mitochondrial depolarization directly, rather than activating upstream stress signals, and suggest that Vpr may induce apoptosis rapidly after being expressed (Figure 7B).	[[39, 42], [155, 158]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13950	We reasoned that if Vpr induced apoptosis by interacting directly with the mitochondria, it would efficiently induce apoptosis regardless of cell cycle status.	[[20, 23]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13951	In contrast with the previous expectation, we observed that cell cycle transition into G2 is required for Vpr to induce apoptosis.	[[106, 109]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13952	[23] proposed that the mitochondrial channel activated by Vpr is the PTPC.	[[58, 61]]	[]	['Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13953	In sharp contrast, we find that efficient removal of ANT (an essential domain of PTPC) did not affect Vpr apoptosis to any degree.	[[53, 56], [81, 85], [102, 105]]	[]	['ANT', 'PTPC', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13954	Furthermore, Bax activation is dependent on the presence of ATR, as is induction of apoptosis.	[[60, 63]]	[]	['ATR']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml
13955	Taken together, our data strongly support a model in which the apical step toward Vpr-induced apoptosis is activation of ATR, followed by the activation of downstream apoptotic mediators such as Bax, Smac, and caspases (Figure 7)..

13957	The discovery of mutations in Vpr that may be associated with long-term nonprogressors and impair the apoptosis-inducing ability of Vpr suggests a critical role for Vpr in AIDS pathology [21,22,58].	[[30, 33], [132, 135], [165, 168]]	[]	['Vpr', 'Vpr', 'Vpr']	[]	PMC1665652.nxml

13999	Data from a variety of experimental models suggest that natural killer (NK) cells require signals from accessory cells in order to respond optimally to pathogens, but the precise identity of the cells able to provide such signals depends upon the nature of the infectious organism.

14002	The magnitude of the NK cell response (and of the KIR− CD56bright NK cell population in particular) is tightly correlated with resting levels of accessory cell maturation, indicating that heterogeneity of the NK response to malaria is a reflection of deep-rooted heterogeneity in the human innate immune system.

14011	The key element in the cell-mediated effector response to malaria is the rapid induction of interferon (IFN)–γ [2–6].	[[104, 107]]	[[92, 102]]	['IFN']	['interferon']	PMC1687207.nxml
14012	We have shown that human natural killer (NK) cells can be an important early source of IFN-γ after exposure of leukocytes to Plasmodium falciparum–infected red blood cells (iRBCs) [7–9], although this response is extremely heterogeneous [8,9]..

14015	For example, following exposure to iRBCs, both human DCs and monocytes secrete the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) [13,14], have an impaired ability to mature in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other ligands [13,15–17], and are unable to present antigen to T cells [13].

14036	To confirm and extend this observation, NK cells were purified from PBMCs of seven different donors by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) and stimulated for 24 h with IL-12 and IL-18, uRBCs, or iRBCs or left unstimulated and analysed for surface expression of CD3, CD56, CD69, and intracellular IFN-γ; unsorted PBMCs from the same donors were stimulated and analysed in an equivalent fashion (Figure 1).

14037	In PBMC cultures, as expected, IFN-γ+ (CD3− CD56+) NK cells were detected in both cytokine-stimulated and iRBC-stimulated cultures but not in unstimulated or uRBC-stimulated cultures (Figure 1A).

14038	We deliberately selected donors who were known, from previous studies, to be relatively high responders in this assay; nevertheless, the magnitude of the IFN-γ response to iRBCs varied between donors, with between 5% and 50% of NK cells making IFN-γ in response to iRBCs after 24 h (Figure 1C).

14039	In complete contrast, although purified NK cells made IFN-γ in response to cytokine stimulation (Figure 1B), no IFN-γ was produced by purified NK cells in response to iRBCs (Figure 1B and 1C)..

14040	We have shown that up-regulation of surface CD69 expression is a marker of partial (early) activation of NK cells [9], and thus, as expected, up-regulation of CD69 was consistently seen on NK cells within the iRBC-stimulated PBMC population (Figure 1D).	[[209, 213], [105, 107], [189, 191], [225, 229]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14041	Surface CD69 expression tended to be higher on unstimulated purified NK cells than on unstimulated NK cells within PBMCs, presumably because of partial activation during cell separation.	[[69, 71], [99, 101], [115, 119]]	[]	['NK', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14042	However, CD69 surface expression was not significantly up-regulated on purified NK cells after stimulation with iRBCs, and NK CD69 expression was significantly higher among iRBC-stimulated PBMC NK cells than among purified NK cells (Figure 1D)..	[[112, 116], [173, 177], [80, 82], [123, 125], [194, 196], [223, 225], [189, 193]]	[]	['iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14043	Importantly, the inability of purified NK cells to respond to iRBCs is not an artefact of the NK cell purification process as MACS-purified NK cells labelled with CellTracker Green (CTG) and added back to autologous PBMC cultures respond as well to iRBC stimulation as do “untouched” NK cells within PBMCs (Figure 1E)..	[[182, 185], [62, 66], [249, 253], [126, 130], [39, 41], [94, 96], [140, 142], [284, 286], [216, 220], [300, 304]]	[]	['CTG', 'iRBC', 'iRBC', 'MACS', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'PBMC', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14044	Thus, these data indicate that accessory cells within PBMCs are required for both IFN-γ and CD69 expression among iRBC-stimulated NK cells..	[[82, 85], [114, 118], [130, 132], [54, 58]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14045	To identify the accessory cell population(s) required for NK cell activation by iRBCs, PBMCs of known high-responding donors were depleted (by MACS) of cells expressing specific cell surface markers prior to incubation with iRBCs (Figure 2).	[[80, 84], [224, 228], [143, 147], [58, 60], [87, 91]]	[]	['iRBC', 'iRBC', 'MACS', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14046	PBMCs of all the donors tested in these experiments responded to iRBC stimulation, with 5%–40% of all NK cells producing IFN-γ after 24 h.	[[121, 124], [65, 69], [102, 104]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14047	Depletion of accessory cell populations did not affect the ability of NK cells to produce IFN-γ following stimulation with positive control stimuli (IL-12 and IL-18; Figure S1).	[[90, 93], [70, 72]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14048	Depletion of HLA-DR+ cells completely abolished the NK cell IFN-γ response to iRBCs in all donors, but depletion of BDCA-4+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) had no consistent effect on the NK IFN-γ response.	[[137, 139], [13, 16], [60, 63], [183, 186], [78, 82], [52, 54], [180, 182], [142, 145]]	[]	['DC', 'HLA', 'IFN', 'IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK', 'pDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14049	Likewise, depletion of CD19+ B cells did not reduce the NK cell IFN-γ response.	[[64, 67], [56, 58]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14050	However, depleting PBMCs of either CD1c+ myeloid DCs (mDCs) or CD14+ monocytes significantly reduced NK cell IFN-γ responses (monocytes, paired t test, t = 3.63, p = 0.036; mDCs, paired t test, t = 3.82, p = 0.032).	[[49, 51], [109, 112], [54, 57], [173, 176], [101, 103], [19, 23]]	[]	['DC', 'IFN', 'mDC', 'mDC', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14051	In the one donor where depletion using either CD14 or CD1c did not substantially reduce the IFN-γ response (relative response, monocyte-depleted = 0.84, mDC-depleted = 0.90), a double depletion using both antibodies together was performed.	[[92, 95], [153, 156]]	[]	['IFN', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14052	In this case the IFN-γ response was substantially reduced (relative response = 0.32)..	[[17, 20]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14053	These data indicate that the NK cell response to iRBCs is not dependent on a single population of accessory cells; rather, both mDCs and monocytes can provide activating signals for NK cells, and, in most donors, optimal NK activation requires both of these cell types to be present..

14054	Given the numerous published reports indicating that monocyte and DC function is inhibited by exposure to iRBCs [13,14], it was important to determine whether the accessory cells required for NK cell activation were themselves activated by exposure to iRBCs.

14055	PBMCs from ten different donors were therefore stimulated with uRBCs, iRBCs, or E.	[[70, 74], [63, 67]]	[]	['iRBC', 'uRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14056	coli LPS (or left unstimulated, growth medium alone [gm]) for 24 h, and then mDC and monocyte populations were analysed for expression of the activation markers CD40, HLA-DR, and CD80 (Figure 3; isotype control data to exclude non-specific binding of labelled antibodies by activated accessory cells are shown in Figure S2)..

14057	Significant up-regulation of CD40, CD80, and HLA-DR was observed on monocytes from all donors following 24 h incubation with iRBCs (CD40, mean fold increase of median fluorescence intensity [MFI] = 6.3, paired t test, t = 3.59, p = 0.006; HLA-DR, mean fold increase of MFI = 1.7, paired t test, t = 3.42, p = 0.008; CD80, mean fold increase of MFI = 3.0, paired t test, t = 7.56, p < 0.0001).

14058	Activation of mDCs was also observed, with significant up-regulation of CD40 and HLA-DR expression (CD40, mean fold increase of MFI = 2.3, paired t test, t = 3.60, p = 0.006; HLA-DR, mean fold increase of MFI = 2.4, paired t test, t = 3.16, p = 0.012).

14059	There was, however, no significant change in expression of CD80 on mDCs after 24 h co-incubation with iRBCs (mean fold increase of MFI = 1.3, paired t test, t = 2.04, p = 0.072)..	[[102, 106], [131, 134], [67, 70]]	[]	['iRBC', 'MFI', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14060	These data indicate that both mDCs and monocytes are activated after 24 h co-incubation with iRBCs but that the nature of activation differs between the two accessory cell populations.	[[93, 97], [30, 33]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14061	Up-regulation of CD40 is more pronounced in monocytes and up-regulation of HLA-DR is more pronounced in mDCs, whilst up-regulation of CD80 occurs exclusively in monocytes..	[[75, 78], [104, 107]]	[]	['HLA', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14062	To characterise further the activation of accessory cells by iRBCs, we analysed the cytokine response profile after culturing PBMCs for 24 h with iRBCs by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of adherent cells and by Luminex cytokine bead array analysis of culture supernatants (Figure 4)..	[[61, 65], [146, 150], [126, 130]]	[]	['iRBC', 'iRBC', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14063	Levels of IFN-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ mRNA were below the limits of detection of the assay (Figure 4A).	[[10, 13], [27, 30]]	[]	['IFN', 'IFN']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14064	However, after iRBC stimulation there was very marked up-regulation of mRNA for IFN-α and IL-2 and, to a somewhat lesser extent, for IL-10 and IFN-γ but not for IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, or IL-23 (Figure 4B).	[[80, 83], [143, 146], [15, 19]]	[]	['IFN', 'IFN', 'iRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14065	Taken together, these data indicate constitutive or induced expression of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, IFN-α, IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-γ by adherent mononuclear cells stimulated with iRBCs.	[[102, 105], [126, 129], [178, 182]]	[]	['IFN', 'IFN', 'iRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14066	Production of IL-2, IL-10, and IL-12 in response to iRBC stimulation was confirmed at the protein level (Figure 4C); the discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels for IL-12 is most likely explained by the timing of the assays (all of which were conducted after 24 h)..	[[52, 56]]	[]	['iRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14067	NK cell activation by pathogens is typically dependent on accessory cell–secreted cytokines [19–22], and we have shown that IL-12 and, to a somewhat lesser extent, IL-18 are required for optimal NK responses to iRBCs [7,8].	[[211, 215], [195, 197]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14068	To determine whether other accessory cell–derived cytokines are also required for NK activation, the response to iRBCs was analysed in the presence or absence of neutralising antibodies to individual cytokines or their receptors.	[[113, 117], [82, 84]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14069	Of particular interest were those cytokines that we had found (as described above) to be specifically and strongly upregulated by iRBCs, namely IFN-α and IL-2.	[[144, 147], [130, 134]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14070	Also, since TGF-β has recently been reported to be a powerful inhibitor of NK cell activation [23], and since we have shown that induction of TGF-β in vivo in both human and rodent malaria infections is associated with lack of early IFN-γ responses [24,25], it was of considerable interest to determine whether TGF-β might regulate the NK cell IFN-γ response to iRBCs in our in vitro assay system where platelets and mononuclear cells provide an abundant source of latent TGF-β.

14072	In the presence of a blocking antibody to the IFN-α/β receptor, there is a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of the NK cell IFN-γ response to iRBCs (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 6.42, p = 0.023) (Figure 5A) and a similar, but less marked, reduction in CD69 expression (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 5.26, p = 0.034) (Figure S4).

14073	Similarly, neutralisation of IL-2 markedly inhibited NK cell IFN-γ responses in a dose-dependent manner (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 8.79, p = 0.001) (Figure 5B), and CD69 surface expression was also reduced, but to a lesser degree (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 4.43, p = 0.021) (Figure S4).	[[61, 64], [53, 55]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14074	On the other hand, neutralisation of IL-15 had only a minimal effect on NK cell IFN-γ responses (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 1.83, p = 0.209) (Figure 5C) or CD69 expression (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 3.36, p = 0.078) (Figure S4)..

14075	When PBMCs were incubated with iRBCs for 24 h in the presence or absence of increasing doses of neutralising antibody to TGF-β, there was a highly consistent, dose-dependent increase in the proportion of NK cells synthesising IFN-γ, with up to a 3-fold increase in IFN-γ+ NK cells in the presence of 100 μg/ml antibody (paired t test, t = 7.98, p = 0.004) (Figure 5D) and a slight, but statistically significant, increase in CD69 expression (highest antibody dose, paired t test, t = 4.00, p = 0.028) (Figure S4).

14079	Purified NK cells (in the upper chamber of a Transwell culture system) were separated from PBMCs (in the lower chamber) by a microporous membrane (0.4-μm diameter), which allowed diffusion of small molecules including cytokines, but not migration of leukocytes, iRBCs, or extracellular malarial merozoites.	[[262, 266], [9, 11], [91, 95]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14080	When a soluble positive control stimulus (phytohaemagglutinin) was added to the lower well, NK cells in the inner (top) well responded normally, indicating that diffusion of soluble signals was not impeded (Figure S5).	[[92, 94]]	[]	['NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14081	When iRBCs were added to the lower chamber, NK cells within the PBMC population synthesised IFN-γ (Figure 6A, PBMC control) and upregulated CD69 (Figure 6B, PBMC control).	[[92, 95], [5, 9], [44, 46], [64, 68], [110, 114], [157, 161]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'PBMC', 'PBMC', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14082	However, addition of iRBCs to the upper well, the lower well, or both the upper and lower wells together was insufficient to induce optimal IFN-γ production among the NK cells in the upper well, suggesting that contact-mediated interactions between NK cells and iRBCs and/or between accessory cells and iRBCs are insufficient for full NK activation and that direct cell–cell contact between the NK cells and the accessory cells is required..	[[140, 143], [21, 25], [262, 266], [303, 307], [167, 169], [249, 251], [335, 337], [395, 397]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14083	Contact between NK cells and accessory cells was also required for optimal up-regulation of CD69, although partial up-regulation of CD69 was observed in some cases when purified NK cells were in contact with iRBCs and/or when accessory cells were in contact with iRBCs.	[[208, 212], [263, 267], [16, 18], [178, 180]]	[]	['iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14084	The up-regulation of CD69 by purified NK cells in the Transwell system (Figure 6), but not in regular cultures of purified NK cells (Figure 1), is presumably due to the presence of soluble, cytokine-mediated signals derived from PBMCs in the lower well..	[[38, 40], [123, 125], [229, 233]]	[]	['NK', 'NK', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14085	In recent years it has become apparent that interactions between NK cells and DCs can be bidirectional.	[[78, 80], [65, 67]]	[]	['DC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14086	NK cells, especially those activated by prior exposure to IL-2, enhance DC maturation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation in allogeneic situations and when exposed to virus-infected cells [28–30].	[[72, 74]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14087	On the other hand, the degree of reciprocity between NK cells and monocytes, and the potential for NK cells to augment accessory cell responses to non-viral pathogens, has not to our knowledge been investigated.	[[53, 55], [99, 101]]	[]	['NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14088	We therefore examined whether the interactions that we had observed to be crucial for the activation of NK cells by iRBCs led to reciprocal activation of either monocytes or mDCs..	[[116, 120], [174, 177], [104, 106]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14089	Whole PBMCs or PBMCs depleted of NK cells were cultured for 24 h without stimulation (gm) or with LPS or iRBCs.	[[86, 88], [105, 109], [98, 101], [33, 35], [6, 10], [15, 19]]	[]	['gm', 'iRBC', 'LPS', 'NK', 'PBMC', 'PBMC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14090	After 24 h, cells were stained for HLA-DR, CD14, either CD40 or CD80, and either CD11c or CD11b (Figure 7A).	[[35, 38]]	[]	['HLA']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14091	Both mDCs and monocytes expressed significantly lower levels of activation markers when cultured (without additional stimulation) in the absence of NK cells (Figure 7B–7D), confirming a previous report of a role for NK cells in promoting DC maturation [29] and extending this observation to monocytes.	[[238, 240], [5, 8], [148, 150], [216, 218]]	[]	['DC', 'mDC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14092	On the other hand, when cells were cultured with either LPS or iRBCs, there was no significant effect of the presence or absence of NK cells on expression levels of any of the activation markers in either mDCs or monocytes (Figure 7B–7D).	[[63, 67], [56, 59], [205, 208], [132, 134]]	[]	['iRBC', 'LPS', 'mDC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14093	Thus, while NK cells play a role in maturation of both monocytes and mDCs in resting conditions, the response of either of these cell types to LPS or iRBC stimulation is largely NK cell–independent.	[[150, 154], [143, 146], [69, 72], [12, 14], [178, 180]]	[]	['iRBC', 'LPS', 'mDC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14094	These data suggest that, at this early time point, the major inducers of myeloid cell activation are the pathogens themselves, rather than NK-derived IFN-γ..	[[150, 153], [139, 141]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14095	We have previously shown that human NK cell responses to iRBCs are heterogeneous [8,9].	[[57, 61], [36, 38]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14096	Here, we noticed a considerable degree of heterogeneity of accessory cell surface marker expression (Figure 3D) and of cytokine production (Figure 4) among donors, in terms of both resting levels and responses to iRBCs.	[[213, 217]]	[]	['iRBC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14097	Given the absolute dependence of the NK cell response to iRBCs on accessory cells, we sought to determine whether heterogeneity of NK cell responses correlated with heterogeneity of accessory cell responses.	[[57, 61], [37, 39], [131, 133]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14098	Since NK cell IFN-γ responses can vary between CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells—presumably because of differential expression of NK cell receptors including the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which are expressed by CD56dim but not CD56bright NK cells—we analysed the correlation between accessory cell and NK cell responses for both of these NK cell populations..	[[14, 17], [203, 206], [6, 8], [70, 72], [128, 130], [260, 262], [324, 326], [360, 362]]	[[160, 200]]	['IFN', 'KIR', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK']	['killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor']	PMC1687207.nxml
14099	Highly significant correlations were observed between iRBC-induced concentrations of IL-12 (Figure 8A) and IL-2 (Figure 8B) and the magnitude of the NK cell IFN-γ response.	[[157, 160], [54, 58], [149, 151]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14100	A particularly close correlation was observed between IL-12 concentrations and the proportion of IFN-γ+ CD56bright (KIR−) cells, whilst, for several donors (see arrows in Figure 8), a significant discrepancy was seen in the response of the CD56dim population.	[[97, 100]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14101	Somewhat surprisingly, there was no correlation between iRBC-induced up-regulation of HLA-DR, CD40, or CD80 on either monocytes or mDCs and NK IFN-γ production (unpublished data).	[[86, 89], [143, 146], [56, 60], [131, 134], [140, 142]]	[]	['HLA', 'IFN', 'iRBC', 'mDC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14102	However, resting levels of expression of both CD40 and HLA-DR were tightly correlated with the NK cell IFN-γ response (Figure 8C and 8D).	[[55, 58], [103, 106], [95, 97]]	[]	['HLA', 'IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14103	For resting levels of CD40 expression there was again a much closer correlation with the IFN-γ response of CD56bright NK cells than with that of CD56dim NK cells.	[[89, 92], [118, 120], [153, 155]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14104	One plausible interpretation of these data is that the NK cell IFN-γ response is very sensitive to accessory cell CD40 expression and IL-12 production, but that in CD56dim cells this response is moderated by KIR/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I–mediated signals..	[[63, 66], [246, 249], [55, 57]]	[[212, 244]]	['IFN', 'MHC', 'NK']	['major histocompatibility complex']	PMC1687207.nxml
14105	Our observation that TGF-β is able to markedly suppress NK cell IFN-γ responses (Figure 5) led us to consider whether the heterogeneity of NK cell responses was due to differential production and/or activation of TGF-β.	[[64, 67], [56, 58], [139, 141], [21, 24], [213, 216]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'NK', 'TGF', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14106	There was no consistent increase or decrease in the concentration of bioactive TGF-β in the supernatants of iRBC-stimulated PBMCs; a modest increase in bioactive TGF-β concentration was observed for two donors, but these were, in fact, the donors with the highest NK cell IFN-γ responses to iRBCs, suggesting that suppression by TGF-β does not explain the heterogeneity of NK cell IFN-γ response.	[[272, 275], [381, 384], [108, 112], [291, 295], [264, 266], [373, 375], [124, 128], [79, 82], [162, 165], [329, 332]]	[]	['IFN', 'IFN', 'iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK', 'PBMC', 'TGF', 'TGF', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14107	Rather, regulation of bioactive TGF-β appears to be positively correlated with NK cell IFN-γ expression (Figure 8E), and furthermore, the correlation with CD56dim NK cells was higher than that with CD56bright NK cells.	[[87, 90], [79, 81], [163, 165], [209, 211], [32, 35]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14108	This suggests that TGF-β is not causal in NK cell activation, but rather that the total amount of IFN-γ produced determines the amount of TGF-β.	[[98, 101], [42, 44], [19, 22], [138, 141]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'TGF', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14109	By carefully dissecting the requirements for activation of human NK cells by iRBCs, we have revealed that the early NK cell–derived IFN-γ response is absolutely dependent upon contact with, and cytokine production by, accessory cells.	[[132, 135], [77, 81], [65, 67], [116, 118]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14110	We have identified the requisite accessory cells as monocytes and mDCs and have shown that both cell types become highly activated during the first 24 h of exposure to iRBCs.	[[168, 172], [66, 69]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14111	Furthermore, we have demonstrated that whilst NK cells provide essential signals that maintain the maturation status of resting monocytes and mDCs, NK cells are not required for these same cells to respond fully to iRBCs.	[[215, 219], [142, 145], [46, 48], [148, 150]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14112	Finally, we have shown that the capacity of NK cells to secrete IFN-γ is highly correlated with both the resting phenotype of the accessory cells and the concentration of iRBC-induced monokines.	[[64, 67], [171, 175], [44, 46]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14113	Thus, functional heterogeneity of monocytes and mDCs among human populations appears to play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the innate immune response to iRBCs..	[[170, 174], [48, 51]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14114	A wealth of evidence suggests that, after interaction with malarial parasites, both monocytes and mDCs secrete immunosuppressive cytokines and have an impaired ability to respond to a variety of stimulatory ligands [13–17,31].	[[98, 101]]	[]	['mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14115	These data have led some to conclude that monocyte and DC function is universally impaired by contact with malarial parasites and that this underlies an apparent suppression of immune responses seen during malaria infections.	[[55, 57]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14116	However, there have been several reports of activation of monocytes and DCs by Plasmodium-derived ligands [32–34].	[[72, 74]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14117	Studies of rodent malaria infections have begun to resolve this debate, showing that in the first 24 h of infection, splenic DCs are activated, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor-α, and present antigen to T cells, but that they subsequently become refractory to re-stimulation and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 [35].	[[125, 127]]	[]	['DC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14118	Here we show that human monocytes and mDCs are highly activated after 24 h of co-incubation with iRBCs.	[[97, 101], [38, 41]]	[]	['iRBC', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14119	The myeloid cell response occurred in the presence or absence of NK cells, indicating that direct interaction with parasites—as opposed to NK-derived IFN-γ—drives the initial activation of these cells.	[[150, 153], [65, 67], [139, 141]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14120	Furthermore, this activation initiates and regulates the crucial early burst of IFN-γ from NK cells.	[[80, 83], [91, 93]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14121	However, our observation that NK activation goes hand in hand with IL-10 and TGF-β production, and that TGF-β can suppress NK IFN-γ production, is consistent with the notion that pro-inflammatory responses to malaria are carefully regulated by homeostatic mechanisms to prevent immune-mediated pathology..	[[126, 129], [30, 32], [123, 125], [77, 80], [104, 107]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'NK', 'TGF', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14122	Our observations regarding the accessory cell requirements for NK cell activation by malaria parasites are in partial agreement with a previous report invoking a role for monocytes in this response [36]; however, we show that mDCs play an equally important role.	[[226, 229], [63, 65]]	[]	['mDC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14123	The fact that NK activation is suboptimal but not absent in the presence of only one or the other accessory cell population suggests that although there is some redundancy in their roles, they also provide complementary signals.	[[14, 16]]	[]	['NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14124	Our data are consistent with reports of leukocyte activation by malarial glycosylphosphatidylinositol signalling through toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 [37], which are both expressed on monocytes and mDCs but not pDCs [38,39], although a role for other receptors cannot be ruled out.	[[205, 208], [218, 221], [141, 144]]	[[121, 139]]	['mDC', 'pDC', 'TLR']	['toll-like receptor']	PMC1687207.nxml
14125	The reported activation of pDCs by a malarial hemozoin–TLR9 pathway [40,41] does not appear to be required for NK IFN-γ production, consistent with previous reports that NK cytotoxic activity but not IFN-γ secretion is dependent on pDC-derived signals [42,43].	[[114, 117], [200, 203], [111, 113], [170, 172], [27, 30], [232, 235]]	[]	['IFN', 'IFN', 'NK', 'NK', 'pDC', 'pDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14126	In fact, depletion of pDCs increased the IFN-γ response of NK cells in two out of three donors, suggesting that pDCs may have a net anti-inflammatory effect in this system, perhaps mediated by either IL-10 or TGF-β.	[[41, 44], [59, 61], [22, 25], [112, 115], [209, 212]]	[]	['IFN', 'NK', 'pDC', 'pDC', 'TGF']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14127	The data presented here reveal that accessory cell–dependent activation of NK cells by iRBCs is multifactorial and, as in other systems, involves multiple cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-α) [44–46] as well as direct contact between NK cells and accessory cells [12,22,26,27].	[[190, 193], [87, 91], [75, 77], [239, 241]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14128	Whether accessory cells are the source of IL-2, as recently reported for human pDCs and mDCs [47], is not clear, and we cannot rule out that IL-2 is produced by a small contaminating population of rapidly responding T cells.	[[88, 91], [79, 82]]	[]	['mDC', 'pDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14129	Contact-dependent signals might include CD40–CD40L signalling [12], delivery of IL-12 from mDCs via an immune synapse [48], or binding of MHC–peptide complexes by activating KIR [49].	[[174, 177], [91, 94]]	[]	['KIR', 'mDC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14130	We believe that indirect, accessory cell–mediated signals are likely to be the major mechanism of NK cell activation by iRBCs, but we cannot rule out that the NK cell receives additional signals via direct interaction with iRBCs.	[[120, 124], [223, 227], [98, 100], [159, 161]]	[]	['iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14131	Stable contacts between iRBCs and NK cells have been reported by ourselves and by others [9,36], and we have observed reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton at the point of iRBC–NK contact [9]; the functional consequence of these interactions are, however, not yet fully understood..	[[24, 28], [34, 36], [180, 182]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14132	Our observation that NK cells are not required for optimal activation of monocytes and mDCs by pathogen-derived ligands (iRBCs and LPS) runs somewhat counter to previous reports that NK cells augment DC maturation, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation [28–30].	[[200, 202], [121, 125], [131, 134], [87, 90], [21, 23], [183, 185]]	[]	['DC', 'iRBC', 'LPS', 'mDC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14133	One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the sequence of events leading to activation of NK cells and accessory cells depends on the nature of the stimulus.	[[103, 105]]	[]	['NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14134	In the case of virally infected or neoplastic cells, altered expression of MHC or MHC-like ligands on the target cell will lead to direct activation of NK cells either through engagement of natural cytotoxicity receptors or changes in the balance of activating and inhibitory signals delivered by KIR receptors (reviewed in [50]).	[[297, 300], [75, 78], [82, 85], [152, 154]]	[]	['KIR', 'MHC', 'MHC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14135	In this case, amplification of the innate response and induction of adaptive immunity would be facilitated if NK cells were able to provide activating signals to DCs and other antigen-presenting cells, which are much less sensitive to changes in MHC expression.	[[162, 164], [246, 249], [110, 112]]	[]	['DC', 'MHC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14136	On the other hand, in the case of bacterial and protozoal pathogens, which do not grossly alter MHC class I expression or induce MHC-related stress ligands on host cells, direct activation of NK cells is unlikely.	[[96, 99], [129, 132], [192, 194]]	[]	['MHC', 'MHC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14137	Rather, DCs and monocytes are likely to be directly activated by binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors and may not require additional signals from NK cells..	[[8, 10], [207, 209], [118, 121]]	[]	['DC', 'NK', 'TLR']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14138	Given the importance of the innate response to malaria in determining the outcome of disease (reviewed in [1]), dissecting the basis for the heterogeneity of the human NK cell response to iRBCs could be crucial in understanding disease susceptibility.	[[188, 192], [168, 170]]	[]	['iRBC', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14139	The close correlations shown here between accessory cell maturation, accessory cell responses to iRBCs, and induction of IFN-γ production by NK cells suggest that heterogeneity of NK cell responses to iRBCs [8,9] is a reflection of deeply rooted heterogeneity of innate responses within the human population.	[[121, 124], [97, 101], [201, 205], [141, 143], [180, 182]]	[]	['IFN', 'iRBC', 'iRBC', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14140	Multiple genes, including various IFN regulatory factor proteins and components of the colony stimulating factor 1 signalling pathway, influence the maturation status of accessory cells [51–53].	[[34, 37]]	[]	['IFN']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14141	Moreover, the much stronger correlation of accessory cell status with activation of CD56bright (KIR−) NK cells than with activation of CD56dim (KIR+) NK cells suggests that NK cell activation by pathogen-induced accessory cell signals may be modulated by NK cell receptor expression.	[[102, 104], [150, 152], [173, 175], [255, 257]]	[]	['NK', 'NK', 'NK', 'NK']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14142	Since KIR genes, along with MHC genes, are some of the most highly polymorphic loci in the human genome [54], dissecting the genetic basis of diversity in the human innate response is a daunting task.	[[6, 9], [28, 31]]	[]	['KIR', 'MHC']	[]	PMC1687207.nxml
14143	Nevertheless, as CD56dim cells are the major population of NK cells in peripheral blood and spleen [55], our data suggest that NK cell receptor expression is likely to have a significant influence on overall NK cell responsiveness and thus potentially affect the severity of malarial disease and other systemic infections.

14144	Since the antigen-presenting and co-stimulatory functions of accessory cells are pivotal for induction of adaptive immunity, and the magnitude of the early IFN-γ response affects adaptive responses [56], heterogeneity of expression of CD40, HLA-DR, and NK cell IFN-γ is likely to have a profound impact on the generation of acquired immune responses..

14201	Furthermore, based on experiments with HIV-1 subtype B, the first HIV-1 subtype identified [11], it has been suggested that signal transduction pathways and transcription factors acting to modulate HIV-1 gene expression through the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) enhancer region are distinct in the monocyte/macrophage lineage and dendritic cells as compared with T cells [7,12]..	[[260, 263]]	[[238, 258]]	['LTR']	['long terminal repeat']	PMC1698943.nxml
14202	However, the majority of HIV-1 gene transcription studies have been performed using isolates of subtype B, although multiple HIV-1 subtypes have a major role in the global HIV-1 pandemic, and each subtype has a distinct sequence of transcription factor binding sites in its LTR [14–18].

14204	Although the NF-κB motifs within the core κB enhancer/basal promoter of the HIV-1 subtype B LTR are canonical binding sites for the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer [22], they are also recognized by the calcineurin-dependent proteins of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family [26–32], which shares a structurally conserved DNA-binding motif with the NF-κB proteins, the rel homology region (reviewed in [33–35])..

[[33, 37]]	[]	['NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14206	The most recently identified NFAT protein, NFAT5 (also known as TonEBP) [39], is the most evolutionarily divergent member of the NFAT family: NFAT5 has a homolog in Drosophila, while NFATp, NFATc, NFAT3, and NFAT4 are found exclusively in vertebrates [40].	[[29, 33], [129, 133]]	[]	['NFAT', 'NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14207	NFAT5 was classified as an NFAT protein on the basis of its rel homology region domain, since it has greater sequence similarity with the NFAT protein family than with NF-κB proteins [39], but it is a unique member in many important respects.

14208	Specifically, (i) unlike the other NFAT proteins, NFAT5 binds DNA as an obligate dimer in a fashion similar to the NF-κB proteins; (ii) NFAT5 does not cooperate with the basic region leucine zipper proteins Fos and Jun in gene activation; and (iii) NFAT5 functions independently of calcinuerin [39,41] (reviewed in [33–35]).

14223	To examine the regulation of HIV-1 subtypes by NFAT proteins, we first cloned and sequenced the LTR region (−208 to +64 nt) of representative primary HIV-1 C (HIV-198IN22, India and HIV-1CH01, China) and E (HIV-1KR25, Cambodia) and HIV-193TH64 (Thailand)) isolates.	[[96, 99], [47, 51], [120, 122]]	[]	['LTR', 'NFAT', 'nt']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14224	We analyzed at least ten clones from each isolate, determined the dominant sequences, and compared these results with LTR sequences that we cloned from the lab-adapted B subtype strains HIV-1BAL and HIV-1LAI (Figure 1).	[[118, 121]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14225	It overlaps the NF-κB site proximal to the start site of transcription in the subtype B isolates, the single NF-κB site in the subtype E isolates, and the central NF-κB site in the subtype C isolates (Figure 1).

14226	We note that these NFAT5 binding motifs also coincide with NFATp/NFATc binding sites previously detected in the LTRs of the HIV-1 B, C, and E subtypes [17,27,30]..	[[112, 115]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14227	To establish the pattern of NFAT5 binding to B, C, and E LTRs, we next compared the binding of recombinant NF-κB p50/p65, NFATp, and NFAT5 proteins to the LTRs (−208 to +64 nt relative to the transcription start site) from HIV-1 subtypes B (HIV-1LAI), C (HIV-1CH01 and HIV-198IN22), and E (HIV-193TH64), using quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis..

14228	We detected binding of p50/p65 at the two consensus sites in the B subtype LTR and the single consensus site in the E subtype; furthermore, p50/p65 bound to these sites with similar affinities (Figure 2A, panels 1 and 3; also see summary in Figure 2B).	[[75, 78]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14229	Interestingly, although the C subtype has three putative NF-κB binding motifs and the B subtype has two, approximately the same number of nucleotides is protected from DNase cleavage using the C and B LTRs, since binding of p50/p65 does not extend to the 3′ κB site in the subtype C LTR (Figure 2B).	[[201, 204], [283, 286], [57, 62]]	[]	['LTR', 'LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14230	The lack of binding of p50/p65 to the 3′ site in the C subtypes can be ascribed to the presence of a thymine or cytosine in place of the purine that is typically in the fourth position of most NF-κB binding motifs (reviewed in [49,50]).	[[193, 198]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14231	We note that a cytosine has been observed in the fourth position of putative NF-κB motifs in other C isolates [17,29]..	[[77, 82]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14232	Consistent with previous reports [17,29,51], NFATp binds to sequences that overlap the NF-κB sites of the three subtypes (Figure 2A and 2B).	[[87, 92]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14233	This can be explained by further inspection of the LTR sequences (Figure 2B).	[[51, 54]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14234	The B and C subtypes contain two identical copies of NF-κB sites (both κB sites in B and the 5′ and central κB sites in C); previous studies based on the B subtype LTR sequence have shown that NFATp binds as a dimer to this site [28,52].	[[164, 167], [53, 58]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14235	These sites are 9-bp (base pair) inverted repeats of GGA core motifs (bold black font in Figure 2B), a consensus sequence that preferentially binds the NFATp dimer (J.	[[18, 20]]	[[22, 31]]	['bp']	['base pair']	PMC1698943.nxml
14236	Thanos, et al., unpublished data); this pattern does not appear in the 3′ NF-κB-like site in the C subtype, which fails to bind NFATp or NF-κB p50/p65.	[[74, 79], [137, 142]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14237	The E subtype LTR has one copy of the conserved NF-κB site and an 8-bp inverted repeat of the GGA core motif (see dotted line boxed sequences and green font in Figure 2B), which is not optimal spacing for NFATp dimer binding (J.	[[68, 70], [14, 17], [48, 53]]	[]	['bp', 'LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14238	We next investigated whether NFAT5 could bind to the three LTRs, given that they contain a consensus NFAT5 binding site, 5′-RNRNNTTTCCA-3′ [39], overlapping the NF-κB/NFATp dimer binding site proximal to the transcription start site (Figure 2A, panels 7–9).	[[59, 62]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14239	We found that NFAT5 protected an approximately equal number of nucleotides in each LTR (Figure 2B), footprinting at the B isolate LTR (Figure 2A, panel 7) more weakly than the C and E isolates (Figure 2A, panels 8 and 9).	[[83, 86], [130, 133]]	[]	['LTR', 'LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14240	Thus, NFAT5, unlike p50/p65, discriminates between the tandem NF-κB motifs of the B and C subtype LTRs (Figure 2B)..	[[98, 101], [62, 67]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14241	These results thus define the binding site selectivity for NF-κB p50/p65, NFATp, and NFAT5 at the LTRs of representatives of three different HIV-1 subtypes.	[[98, 101], [59, 64]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14242	In the case of the HIV-1 LTR in three major viral subtypes, a single nucleotide difference, an adenine immediately 3′ of the NF-κB sites, confers selective binding of NFAT5..	[[25, 28], [125, 130]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14243	We next examined the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/content/hiv-db/mainpage.html) for LTRs from representatives of HIV-1 Group M (for main) subtypes A through G, HIV-1 Group O, HIV-2, and five SIV LTRs [17,56], including SIVCPZ, the closest relative to HIV-1 [57], to determine whether the NFAT5 binding site we had discovered was present in other viral subtypes and in SIVs.

14244	Remarkably, we found complete conservation of the NFAT5 binding motif, including the 3′ adenine that confers selective NFAT5 binding over closely related NF-κB sites, in each of these LTRs (Figure 3)..	[[184, 187], [154, 159]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14245	We next examined the functional impact of NFAT5 binding upon LTR-mediated activation of transcription.	[[61, 64]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14246	Inspection of the NF-κB/NFATp/NFAT5 shared binding element suggested that we could disrupt NFAT5 but not NF-κB binding by mutating two of the thymines to cytosines in this motif in the HIV-1LAI subtype B LTR (N5-Mut in Figure 4A); in fact, these mutations convert the site to a canonical NF-κB p50/p65 site that is found in the major histocompatibility complex class I H2-κB enhancer and other promoter regions (reviewed in [50]).

14247	An EMSA using the wild-type and NFAT5 (N5-Mut) mutant oligonucleotides confirmed that changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the N5-Mut did indeed significantly inhibit NFAT5 binding without disrupting the binding of p50/p65.	[[3, 7], [39, 45], [128, 134]]	[]	['EMSA', 'N5-Mut', 'N5-Mut']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14248	We next were interested in determining whether this specific mutation of the NFAT5 binding site resulted in a change in LTR-mediated gene activation.	[[120, 123]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14249	We thus introduced the CC to TT change in the context of an HIV-1 B subtype (HIV-1LAI) LTR-luciferase reporter gene spanning −208 to +64 nt relative to the transcription start site, transfected the wild-type and NFAT-5 mutant LTR reporter genes into the human monocytic cell line THP-1, and measured LTR driven luciferase activity 36 h later.

14250	We note that NFAT5 is present in nuclear extracts from unstimulated THP-1 monocytic cells and binds to the wild-type LTR oligonucleotide (Figure S1).	[[117, 120]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14251	The NFAT5-specific mutation, which does not impact NF-κB binding to this site, inhibited HIV-1LAI LTR expression by approximately 65% (p < 0.01) (Figure 4B).	[[98, 101], [51, 56]]	[]	['LTR', 'NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14252	These data thus provide a direct link between the binding of NFAT5 at the core NFAT5/NF-κB/NFATp element of the HIV-1LAI LTR and the ability of this LTR to activate transcription..	[[121, 124], [149, 152]]	[]	['LTR', 'LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14253	We designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against NFAT5 and used these to block NFAT5 mRNA expression (Figure 5A) and protein production (Figure 5B) in HeLa-CD4 cells.	[[35, 40]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14254	To confirm the specificity of NFAT5 RNA inhibition, we designed another distinct NFAT5-specific siRNA targeting a different exon of NFAT5.	[[96, 101]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14255	We performed four independent experiments and demonstrated that both siRNAs significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) NFAT5 mRNA expression in HeLa-CD4 cells (Figure 5A).	[[69, 74]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14256	We also investigated the impact of siRNA directed against NFAT5 upon NFAT5 protein production using intracellular staining for NFAT5.	[[35, 40]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14257	As shown in the experiment displayed in Figure 5B (which is representative of four independent experiments), NFAT5 protein expression was lower in the cells transfected with an NFAT5 siRNA than in those mock transfected or transfected with the GFP siRNA..

14258	We next transfected HeLa-CD4 cells with each of the two NFAT5-specific siRNAs or with GFP siRNA as a control.	[[86, 89], [71, 76], [90, 95]]	[]	['GFP', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml

14261	Furthermore, using a p24 ELISA assay, we demonstrated that virus replication was significantly (p < 0.04) reduced in the supernatants of cells transfected with either one of the specific NFAT5 siRNAs compared with virus replication in supernatants from cells that were transfected with GFP siRNA or mock transfected (Figure 5D)..

14262	We generated MDMs from normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells and found that NFAT5 mRNA (Figure 6A) and protein (Figure 6B) are constitutively expressed in these cells..	[[13, 16]]	[]	['MDM']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14263	We performed five independent experiments and demonstrated that NFAT5 siRNA (NFAT5#1) significantly inhibited (p < 0.02) NFAT5 mRNA expression in MDM cells (Figure 6A).	[[146, 149], [70, 75]]	[]	['MDM', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14264	We note that the second specific NFAT5 siRNA behaved identically in two experiments where it was tested (unpublished data).	[[39, 44]]	[]	['siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml

14267	We next transfected MDMs with NFAT5 siRNA or GFP siRNA (control) and then 4 d later infected the cells with HIV-1Bal (B subtype) and monitored virus replication.	[[45, 48], [20, 23], [36, 41], [49, 54]]	[]	['GFP', 'MDM', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14268	As shown in Figure 6C, there was a 26.9% reduction in intracellular p24 levels in cells transfected with NFAT5 siRNA compared with the cells transfected with GFP siRNA–transfected cells..	[[158, 161], [111, 116]]	[]	['GFP', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml

14271	On day 13 post-infection, we analyzed the inhibition caused by NFAT5 siRNA versus transfection with the GFP siRNA or mock transfection.	[[104, 107], [69, 74], [108, 113]]	[]	['GFP', 'siRNA', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14272	We obtained similar results using each of the two specific siRNAs targeting two different exons of NFAT5 in all of the experiments in MDMs (unpublished data)..	[[134, 137], [59, 64]]	[]	['MDM', 'siRNA']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14273	To verify that infection by HIV-1 itself was not causing an increase in NFAT5 mRNA levels, we infected MDMs with live or heat-inactivated HIV-198IN22, HIV-193TH64, or HIV-1Bal and measured NFAT5 levels by real-time PCR at 24 and 48 h after infection.	[[103, 106]]	[]	['MDM']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14274	Previous studies have demonstrated that a range of transcription factors can interact with the LTR of HIV-1 subtype B (reviewed in [12]), and it has been proposed that distinct sets of host factors may direct transcription driven by the HIV-1 LTR in T cells and macrophages [7].	[[95, 98], [243, 246]]	[]	['LTR', 'LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14275	Remarkably, the functional NFAT5 site, 5′-GGGACTTTCCA-3′, that we have identified in the LTR of isolates of HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and E, is conserved not only across HIV-1 Group M subtypes A through G, but also in HIV-1 Group O and HIV-2 isolates, as well as SIV isolates from multiple primate species (Figure 3)..	[[89, 92], [258, 261]]	[]	['LTR', 'SIV']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14276	The evolutionary pressure toward conservation of this NFAT5 site is particularly striking given the variability of LTR sequences between subtypes and HIV species [17,56], including the number and arrangement of transcription factor binding sites, as illustrated by the binding of NF-κB proteins to HIV-1 subtype B, C, and E LTRs in this study (Figure 2A).

14277	Furthermore, we have shown that a single nucleotide difference, a 3′ adenine, between the NFAT5 site and an upstream NF-κB binding site, confers selective binding of NFAT5 to this conserved enhancer element (Figure 2)..	[[117, 122]]	[]	['NF-κB']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14278	NFAT5 is unique among the NFAT proteins both in its DNA-binding properties and in the upstream signal transduction pathways that regulate its activity.	[[26, 30]]	[]	['NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14279	Unlike the other NFAT family members, NFAT5 binds as an obligate dimer and does not act coordinately with Fos and Jun proteins.	[[17, 21]]	[]	['NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14280	While the nuclear translocation of other NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcinuerin, the activity of NFAT5 has been shown to be regulated by osmotic stress and integrin activation [41–43].	[[41, 45]]	[]	['NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14281	Our findings that NFAT5 is involved in HIV-1 replication in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, as well as in a nonlymphoid model cell line, and that its functional DNA binding site is highly conserved, provide an initial insight into other potential upstream regulatory mechanisms that further distinguish the physiological role of this evolutionarily divergent NFAT protein from its calcineurin-responsive counterparts.	[[369, 373]]	[]	['NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14282	It is interesting to note that the HIV-1 LTR can be activated by osmotic stress in HeLa cells [59]; thus, the upstream signaling pathways involved in NFAT5-dependent HIV-1 replication may overlap with those responsible for osmotic stress-induced transcription of NFAT5-dependent cellular genes.	[[41, 44]]	[]	['LTR']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14283	Even though both NF-κB and NFAT proteins interact with the conserved NFAT5 site, our results have demonstrated a specific role for NFAT5 in the replication of HIV-1 in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.	[[17, 22], [27, 31]]	[]	['NF-κB', 'NFAT']	[]	PMC1698943.nxml
14284	Strikingly, replacement of the NFAT5 site with a canonical NF-κB site inhibits activity of the HIV-1 LTR, and direct inhibition of NFAT5 using siRNA inhibits replication of HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and E in primary human macrophages.

14332	Extracted metabolites were measured via LC-MS/MS, with the LC separation involving hydrophilic interaction chromatography on an aminopropyl resin at basic pH, an approach tailored to quantitation of water-soluble cellular metabolites [9].	[[40, 48]]	[]	['LC-MS/MS']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14333	Each metabolite measurement was in the form of a selected reaction monitoring scan event (SRM); formation within the mass spectrometer collision cell of a particular molecular weight product ion from a specific molecule weight parent ion by gas phase collision of the parent ion with argon occurring at a specific chromatographic retention time.

14335	An exception to the one-to-one relationship between metabolites and SRMs was the co-elution of certain metabolite isomers yielding identical fragmentation patterns (e.g., different isomers of glucose-6-phosphate, which we refer to collectively as hexose-phosphate)..

14337	These 63 metabolites included a variety of key components of central carbon metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, including multiple phosphorylated compounds such as ATP and fructose bisphosphate (FBP)..	[[197, 200]]	[[174, 195]]	['FBP']	['fructose bisphosphate']	PMC1698944.nxml
14338	Accordingly, experimental error in the LC-MS/MS measurement is very unlikely to have influenced the biological conclusions of the present work..	[[39, 47]]	[]	['LC-MS/MS']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14339	Protein content, rather than cell number, was used for normalization because HCMV-infected cells increase approximately 2-fold in volume as compared to mock-infected cells.	[[77, 81]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14340	In certain specific cases, we validated our microarray data using quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure 2A)..	[[84, 88]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14341	For example, in Figure 1 we report an increase in FBP at 48 hpi.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['FBP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14342	As production of FBP via phosphofructose kinase-1(PFK-1) is tightly regulated [10–12], whereas consumption of FBP by aldolase is not, the most likely cause of the increase in FBP is increased PFK-1 flux.	[[17, 20], [110, 113], [175, 178]]	[]	['FBP', 'FBP', 'FBP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14343	This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that levels of the aldolase product, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), increase roughly in parallel with those of FBP (if the increase in FBP were due to blockade of aldolase, DHAP levels should drop, not increase).

14344	Glycolysis and the TCA cycle oxidize hexose sugars to form ATP and NADH, the major energy currencies of the cell.	[[19, 22]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14345	While HCMV infection has been previously shown to stimulate glucose uptake in fibroblasts [13], its detailed effect on intracellular carbon metabolism has not been previously investigated..	[[6, 10]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14346	We found that early during infection (i.e., 4–24 hpi), there was little difference in measurable glycolytic pathway metabolites between mock- and HCMV-infected fibroblasts (Figure 1).	[[146, 150], [49, 52]]	[]	['HCMV', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14347	Beginning at 48 hpi, however, differences emerged: FBP, DHAP, 3-phosphogylcerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) increased relative to mock infection (Figure 1)..	[[56, 60], [51, 54], [16, 19], [107, 110]]	[[86, 105]]	['DHAP', 'FBP', 'hpi', 'PEP']	['phosphoenolpyruvate']	PMC1698944.nxml
14348	The increased levels of glycolytic intermediates during HCMV infection correlated with an increase in the transcript levels of several glycolytic enzymes (Figures 1 and 7).	[[56, 60]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14349	Transcript levels were found to be increased at every time point assayed with a peak 6-fold increase at 48 hpi (Figure 2A).	[[107, 110]]	[]	['hpi']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14350	The levels of PFK-1′s product, FBP, also peaked at this time, suggesting increased PFK-1 activity in HCMV-infected cells at 48 hpi.	[[31, 34], [101, 105]]	[]	['FBP', 'HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14351	Addition of fructose-6-phosphate and ATP to lysates of HCMV-infected or mock-infected cells resulted in accumulation of FBP, with the initial rate of accumulation ~4-fold greater for HCMV than mock infection.	[[120, 123], [55, 59], [183, 187]]	[]	['FBP', 'HCMV', 'HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14352	Since PFK-1 regulates glycolytic flow, the increased levels of downstream glycolytic intermediates during HCMV infection likely reflect, at least in part, this increase in PFK-1 activity..	[[106, 110]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14353	Most of the measured glycolytic intermediates increased at 48 hpi relative to their status in mock-infected cells.	[[62, 65]]	[]	['hpi']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14354	However, the increase in FBP was transient, presumably due to its rapid conversion to downstream glycolytic intermediates.	[[25, 28]]	[]	['FBP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14355	The terminal glycolytic metabolite, PEP, increased from 48 hpi onward (Figure 1).	[[59, 62], [36, 39]]	[]	['hpi', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14356	Such a bottleneck could arise from decreased maximum velocity for the pyruvate kinase reaction (e.g., due to decreased pyruvate kinase levels), increased Km of the enzyme for PEP (e.g., due to allosteric regulation or shift to a higher Km isozyme), or failure of pyruvate kinase activity to keep pace with increased flux through upper glycolysis.	[[175, 178]]	[]	['PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14357	Our microarray data revealed increased expression of enzymes linking FBP to PEP (triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase) but decreased expression of pyruvate kinase (Figures 1, 2A, and 7).	[[69, 72], [76, 79]]	[]	['FBP', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14358	Note that the reactions linking DHAP to PEP are associated with net ΔG0′ ~zero [17].	[[32, 36], [40, 43]]	[]	['DHAP', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14359	Thus, irrespective of the activities of the intervening enzymes, DHAP and its products must accumulate in parallel with PEP for glycolysis to continue to run in the net forward direction..	[[65, 69], [120, 123]]	[]	['DHAP', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14360	Levels of alanine increase markedly starting at 48 hpi (Figure 3), in concert with the increase in FBP and other glycolytic intermediates (Figure 1).	[[99, 102], [51, 54]]	[]	['FBP', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14361	Much like PEP, alanine levels grow steadily from 48 hpi onward.	[[52, 55], [10, 13]]	[]	['hpi', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14362	This suggests that overall glycolytic flux (as reflected in part by alanine production) is increased from 48 hpi onward, with shifting enzymatic activity in lower glycolysis altering the balance of FBP versus PEP during this period..	[[198, 201], [109, 112], [209, 212]]	[]	['FBP', 'hpi', 'PEP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14363	Thus, increased phosphofructokinase activity and decreased pyruvate kinase activity, which together may favor use of glycolytic intermediates for production of biosynthetic building blocks, appear to be shared between cancer and HCMV infection..	[[229, 233]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14364	It is the link between glycolysis and the TCA cycle, as well as a hub for fatty acid and amino acid oxidation and de novo lipid biosynthesis.	[[42, 45]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14365	Like alanine, acetyl-CoA can be formed from pyruvate, and like alanine, acetyl-CoA increased dramatically throughout HCMV infection; however, acetyl-CoA is unique in rising even before glycolytic intermediates and ultimately increasing by ~8-fold in infected as compared to uninfected cells (Figure 3).	[[117, 121]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14366	Consistent with this notion, pyruvate dehydrogenase transcript levels were upregulated 2- to 3-fold by the virus both by microarray (Figure 7) and by qPCR (Figure 2)..	[[150, 154]]	[]	['qPCR']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14367	When acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, it is converted, with the addition of oxaloacetate, into citrate.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14368	Throughout infection, the levels of many TCA cycle constituents were increased with respect to mock infection; however, citrate levels were not, although citrate levels did increase in parallel in both mock- and virus-infected samples (Figure 3).	[[41, 44]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14369	Citrate synthase activity is inhibited by increased levels of NADH and succinyl-CoA [20], the levels of which are elevated during HCMV infection (Figure 3), potentially preventing accumulation of citrate (Figure 3).	[[130, 134]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14370	Alternatively, oxaloacetate may be diverted via aspartate into de novo pyrimidine synthesis, which is activated during HCMV infection (Figure 4), thus limiting its availability for citrate synthesis; direct oxaloacetate measurement here was precluded by oxaloacetate instability [9].	[[119, 123]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14371	More likely, however, citrate synthase flux was increased as a consequence of increased acetyl-CoA levels, but citrate levels were kept steady by increased activity of the citrate-consuming enzyme, aconitase, whose mRNA level increased during HCMV infection (Figure 7).	[[243, 247]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14372	Consistent with increased aconitase expression, aconitate (4-fold increased at 24 and 48 hpi) and its downstream TCA cycle products, including succinyl-CoA and malate, increased during infection (Figure 3).	[[89, 92], [113, 116]]	[]	['hpi', 'TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14373	Malic enzyme converts malate to pyruvate, potentially contributing to increased alanine and acetyl-CoA levels and limiting citrate levels, whereas malate dehydrogenase produces oxaloacetate from malate, thus completing the TCA cycle by providing citrate synthase with oxaloacetate..	[[223, 226]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14374	Taken together, these results are most consistent with the hypothesis that HCMV infection stimulates both glycolytic and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux.	[[75, 79]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14375	This could generate the observed high level of acetyl-CoA, which was then used to drive the TCA cycle to produce NADH and eventually ATP, as well as potentially also donating carbon units to lipid biosynthesis, which was not explored here..	[[92, 95]]	[]	['TCA']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14376	The levels of other compounds, e.g., FBP and NADH, decreased (Figures 1 and 3).	[[37, 40]]	[]	['FBP']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14377	One effect of HCMV infection may be to accelerate some of these processes that occur even in its absence; however, acceleration of normal physiological processes is inadequate to account fully for the profound and persistent changes seen in many compounds such as acetyl-CoA and NADH..	[[14, 18]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14378	The first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed in eukaryotes by a homo-trimer of the 230-kDa protein termed carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamoylase-dihydroorotase (CAD), which catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoyl-phosphate, carbamoyl-aspartate, and dihydroorotate [21–23].	[[199, 202]]	[[124, 197]]	['CAD']	['carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamoylase-dihydroorotase']	PMC1698944.nxml
14379	Carbamoyl-phosphate levels remained relatively similar in mock-infected cells versus HCMV-infected cells until 72 h when they started to fall in infected fibroblasts (Figure 4).	[[85, 89]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14380	Levels of carbamoyl-aspartate, in contrast, increased dramatically during viral infection starting at 24 hpi (Figure 4).	[[105, 108]]	[]	['hpi']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14381	While levels of carbamoyl-aspartate increased substantially, levels of the CAD transcript remain unchanged during the course of infection (Figure 4), suggesting that transcriptional activation of the CAD gene is not responsible for the accumulation of carbamoyl-aspartate.	[[75, 78], [200, 203]]	[]	['CAD', 'CAD']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14382	Interestingly, UTP reportedly serves as a feedback inhibitor of CAD activity [24,25] and one would expect that the increased levels of UTP that occur during HCMV infection might inhibit CAD activity, thereby blocking carbamoyl-aspartate accumulation.	[[64, 67], [186, 189], [157, 161]]	[]	['CAD', 'CAD', 'HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14383	One possible explanation for the continued high levels of carbamoyl-aspartate in the face of high UTP is that infection might spatially segregate UTP and CAD into different compartments.	[[154, 157]]	[]	['CAD']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14384	This might involve interplay between the virus and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which has recently been shown to regulate CAD activity/localization [26]..	[[127, 130]]	[]	['CAD']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14385	Another challenge in interpreting the carbamoyl-aspartate accumulation is that the three active sites of CAD are linked by a 96-Å long channel which supposedly localizes carbamoyl-phosphate and carbamoyl-aspartate to the interior of the enzyme [27–29].

14386	Thus, the presence of free carbamoyl-aspartate may indicate profound perturbation of CAD in infected cells, perhaps as the consequence of an interacting virus-coded protein that results in leakage of carbamoyl-aspartate from the enzyme interior..	[[85, 88]]	[]	['CAD']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14387	In contrast to the aforementioned alterations of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, HCMV infection did not dramatically affect purine metabolite pool levels.	[[86, 90]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14388	AMP, ADP, and ATP metabolite levels did not change significantly with respect to mock infection, with the exception of a slight increase in ADP and ATP at 48 h and a small accumulation of AMP after 48 h in HCMV-infected versus mock-infected fibroblasts (Figure 5).	[[206, 210]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14389	The present study does not provide substantial insight into de novo purine biosynthesis however, because the only purine intermediate for which an SRM was included, IMP, could not be measured due to interference from naturally occurring heavy isotopes of AMP (see Materials and Methods).	[[147, 150]]	[]	['SRM']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14390	Pyrimidines, in contrast, do not have equally wide-ranging functions and thus HCMV may have license to more dramatically influence pyrimidine levels..	[[78, 82]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14391	With the exception of alanine, HCMV infection did not induce increased levels of other measured amino acids.	[[31, 35]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml

14393	A number of metabolites were found to decrease rapidly during HCMV infection compared to mock infection of fibroblasts (Figure 6).	[[62, 66]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14394	These metabolites could be grouped generically into those, such as adenosine and carnitine, for which HCMV infection seemed to accelerate decreases that also occurred during mock infection, and others, like myo-inositol and glycerol phosphate, which decreased only in the HCMV infection condition.

14395	Several of the metabolites decreasing during HCMV infection were nucleosides (adenosine and uridine), consistent with use of these metabolites for nucleotide and eventually RNA or DNA biosynthesis.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14396	The results for glycerol-phosphate, while unusually noisy, were striking in that decreases were evident already at 4 hpi, making glycerol-phosphate depletion among the earliest known effects of HCMV infection on cellular metabolism.

14397	Taken together, these results demonstrate that HCMV infection depletes a subset of precursor metabolites, some very rapidly, most likely utilizing them for its own macromolecular synthesis..	[[47, 51]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml
14398	Taurine, an amino acid analog involved in osmoregulation and cell volume control [32], is not an obvious precursor metabolite, but was nevertheless decreased 4-fold by HCMV infection (Figure 6, top left panel).	[[168, 172]]	[]	['HCMV']	[]	PMC1698944.nxml

14402	The relative levels of acetyl-CoA, alanine, carbomoyl-aspartate, succinyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent PEP, NADH, CTP, and TTP, were dramatically elevated in HCMV-infected fibroblasts compared to actively growing fibroblasts (Figure 8).

14437	The dsRNA knockdown of SRPN6 results in a complex phenotype: it temporarily slows down ookinete killing in L3–5 mosquitoes, whilst simultaneously enhancing melanization [12].	[[4, 9]]	[]	['dsRNA']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14438	These organelle-free, actin-rich cytoplasmic formations, for which we propose the term “organelle-free actin zone” (AZ), have since been noted by other authors investigating different host–parasite species combinations (e.g., the “purse-string” [15,16]; the “lamellipodial hood” or “collar” [17]; and the “actin cone” or “ring” [18]).

14440	To address these points, we have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with RNA interference (RNAi)–dependent gene silencing, and have investigated AZ/ookinete co-localization, the composition of the AZ, its control by TEP1 or proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, and its potential role in parasite killing..

14441	Moreover, in the refractory strain, we noted that the majority of dead and dying ookinetes were surrounded by melanin and a zone of polymerized actin within the adjacent midgut cells (the AZ).	[[188, 190]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14442	We show that both features are linked and dependent on TEP1 activity.	[[55, 59]]	[]	['TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14448	Ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium occurred between 18 and 33 hpi and involved a complex route, beginning at the apical (microvillous) surface and ending at the membranous labyrinth beneath the basal lamina (hemocoel side) where the oocyst developed.

14450	This zone, which we call the AZ, is an organelle-free region of the midgut epithelial cell cytoplasm and is contained within its plasma membrane.	[[29, 31]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14451	We observed the AZ at the basal side of both susceptible (G3) and refractory (L3–5) A.	[[16, 18]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14452	The fine structure of the AZ was identical in L3–5 and G3 mosquitoes (Figure 2F).	[[26, 28]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14453	Few ookinetes in G3 mosquitoes displayed an AZ, and when they did, the AZ was usually thin (<200 nm) and surrounded both live (Figure 2A and 2B) and dead, lysed (Figure 2C) ookinetes.	[[44, 46], [71, 73]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14454	In contrast, AZs were more frequently observed in L3–5 mosquito midguts, and formed exclusively around dead or dying ookinetes (Figure 2D and 2E).	[[13, 15]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14455	Approximately 63% of all dead ookinetes within L3–5 midguts were surrounded by an AZ, compared with 53% of the dead parasites in G3 midguts, as judged by TEM (Figure 2G).	[[82, 84], [154, 157]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14456	Additionally, all of the dead ookinetes visible in our TEM study occurred in the extracellular or intercellular spaces (Figure 2H).	[[55, 58]]	[]	['TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14457	Where a parasite contacted several cells, they all contributed to the AZ (e.g., Figure 2E)..	[[70, 72]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14458	The AZ and intracellular ookinetes did not co-localize in our study.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14459	We found that the AZ occurs only in the most basal region of the midgut, where the parasite is almost invariably extracellular.	[[18, 20]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14460	The triple membrane arrangement around the parasite (including both the apical and basal regions of the ookinete) indicated that the AZ did not form as a parasite exited a damaged midgut cell, but rather surrounded an extracellular parasite.	[[133, 135]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14461	The AZ did not usually cover the entire ookinete surface, and its extent and location on the ookinete surface varied (see Figures 2 and 3)..	[[4, 6]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14462	To investigate the composition of the AZ, which is formed by healthy midgut cells, we used confocal and fluorescence microscopy with antibodies and specific dyes that discriminate between various cytoskeletal proteins.	[[38, 40]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14463	The AZ was not stained by an antibody raised against non-polymerized or globular forms of α-actin, nor by anti-β-tubulin.	[[4, 6]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14464	However, polymerized or filamentous actin, as detected by the dye phalloidin, specifically stained the AZ (and midgut muscle fibers) in L3–5 and G3 mosquitoes, and did not stain the parasites.	[[103, 105]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14465	In G3 mosquitoes, the phalloidin staining of the thin AZ was often much fainter than in the L3–5 strain..	[[54, 56]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14466	These images also demonstrate that the AZ is often associated with shape constrictions of the parasite and can limit the dispersal of melanin pigment so that it appears concentrated at one end of the parasite (Figure 3E and 3F).	[[39, 41]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14467	Ookinetes are known to be melanized first at their apical tips closest to the basal lamina, reflecting the hemocoelic origin of the PPO cascade precursors [6].	[[132, 135]]	[]	['PPO']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14468	Typically, melanin was deposited in the confined spaces between the AZ membrane and the ookinete in the extracellular space (Figure 2D and 3F).	[[68, 70]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14469	In some rare cases, however, a triple layer was observed, consisting of first an AZ, then a melanin, and finally a second AZ layer (not shown).	[[81, 83], [122, 124]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14470	The association of the AZ with melanization and dead parasites led us to suspect that AZ formation could be a refractory killing mechanism, a hypothesis also suggested by [14,17].	[[23, 25], [86, 88]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14471	We therefore focused on the prevalence of AZ formation associated with dead parasites in the refractory L3–5 strain, using the more quantitative method of phalloidin staining with fluorescence microscopy..	[[42, 44]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14473	Not surprisingly, the majority (84.9%) of ookinetes in refractory L3–5 mosquitoes were already dead by 28 hpi (Figure 4B), and by 48 hpi, killing was almost total (99.5%), compared with just 13.4% at 24 hpi and 26.5% at 48 hpi in susceptible G3 mosquitoes (Figure 4A).

14474	In the G3 strain, only a small minority of parasites were surrounded by a phalloidin-stained AZ (1.8% at 24 hpi and 5.8% at 48 hpi overall).	[[93, 95], [108, 111], [127, 130]]	[]	['AZ', 'hpi', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14475	In contrast, in the L3–5 strain a phalloidin-positive AZ surrounded 41.2% and 22.3% of ookinetes at 24 hpi and 48 hpi, respectively.	[[54, 56], [103, 106], [114, 117]]	[]	['AZ', 'hpi', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14476	The relative weakness of the phalloidin staining in G3 mosquitoes meant that fewer dead parasites could be detected in association with the AZ than were observed by TEM (see Figure 2G).	[[140, 142], [165, 168]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14477	Melanization was absent in G3 mosquito midguts, but it was the predominant feature associated with ookinetes in L3–5 midguts (62.2% of all parasites at 28 hpi and 86.3% by 48 hpi were melanized).	[[155, 158], [175, 178]]	[]	['hpi', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14478	Furthermore, in this strain, we noted that the formation of the AZ was invariably accompanied by the appearance of melanin.	[[64, 66]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14482	We used dsRNA knockdown of the TEP1 gene to address this question..	[[8, 13], [31, 35]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14483	Knockdown of TEP1 by dsRNA injection enables the majority of ookinetes to survive to the oocyst stage in both the G3 and L3–5 mosquito strains [4].	[[21, 26], [13, 17]]	[]	['dsRNA', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14485	We next studied the ultrastructure of the TEP1 knockdown phenotype, and observed the remarkable abolition of AZ formation around ookinetes in both susceptible and refractory mosquitoes, and also the loss of ookinete melanization in the refractory strain (Figure 5A–5C).

14487	In the TEP1 knockdown mosquitoes, we still observed dead ookinetes that had been lysed independently of TEP1.	[[7, 11]]	[]	['TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14488	These ookinetes also failed to display any evidence of melanization or AZ formation (Figure 5E), indicating the requirement for TEP1 in these phenomena.	[[71, 73], [128, 132]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14489	Live, extracellular ookinetes lacking an associated AZ and melanin were frequently observed at the basal lamina in both strains, lying in close proximity to the normal organelle-containing cytoplasm of the epithelial cell basal labyrinth.	[[52, 54]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14490	The above results show that TEP1 activity is required for AZ formation and ookinete melanization in addition to being required for ookinete killing.	[[58, 60], [28, 32]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14491	First, TEP1 could control ookinete killing directly by activating AZ formation and melanization.	[[66, 68], [7, 11]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14492	Alternatively, melanization and AZ formation might be triggered later by the death of parasites killed by TEP1-dependent mechanisms.	[[32, 34], [106, 110]]	[]	['AZ', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14493	Therefore, to determine whether formation of the AZ is lethal to ookinetes, we used dsRNA knockdown to disrupt actin polymerization (and thereby formation of the AZ), and gauged its effect on ookinete survival..	[[49, 51], [162, 164], [84, 89]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ', 'dsRNA']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14494	To disrupt actin polymerization, we selected to knock down the genes Fz2 and Cdc42, which both control cytoskeletal rearrangements.	[[77, 82], [69, 72]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14495	The aim was to impair AZ formation whilst keeping the activity of TEP1 intact, and thereby examine the functional role of the AZ in ookinete killing.	[[22, 24], [126, 128], [66, 70]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14496	In a parallel microarray study by our group, we identified Fz2 as a gene up-regulated with TEP1 in P.	[[59, 62], [91, 95]]	[]	['Fz2', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14499	The effects of AZ disruption were first investigated at early time-points (28 and 48 hpi) to correspond with the peak times of ookinete killing and appearance of melanin and the AZ.	[[15, 17], [85, 88]]	[]	['AZ', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14502	The efficiency of TEP1, Fz2, and Cdc42 knockdown by dsRNA was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis at 18 and 24 hours post-injection.	[[33, 38], [52, 57], [24, 27], [18, 22]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'dsRNA', 'Fz2', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14503	Fz2 or Cdc42 knockdown did not have significant effects on the normal mosquito midgut morphology, as examined by TEM (an example is given in Figure 7F).	[[7, 12], [113, 116]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14505	Knockdown of Fz2 or Cdc42 resulted in both a significant decrease in the percentage of parasites surrounded by phalloidin-positive material, and a corresponding increase in the percentage of surviving ookinetes at 28 hpi and 48 hpi compared with the dslacZ control mosquitoes (Figure 6A and 6B).

14506	The Fz2 knockdown mosquitoes also contained a lower percentage of melanized parasites overall, and at 48 hpi both Fz2 and Cdc42 knockdown mosquitoes had significantly fewer melanized parasites (of which even fewer were associated with phalloidin staining) than the controls.	[[122, 127], [4, 7], [114, 117], [105, 108]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2', 'Fz2', 'hpi']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14507	In addition, we observed that melanization of ookinetes was often aberrant or incomplete in the Fz2 and Cdc42 knockdown mosquitoes, resulting in semi-transparent capsules or thin crescents of melanin limited to a small area of the parasite surface (not shown)..	[[104, 109], [96, 99]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14508	These results indicated that Fz2 and Cdc42 are important for the assembly of the AZ and (by an unknown relationship) for melanization.	[[81, 83], [37, 42], [29, 32]]	[]	['AZ', 'Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14509	We therefore next investigated whether perturbation of these events by the knockdown of Fz2 and Cdc42 would result in increased numbers of surviving oocysts..	[[96, 101], [88, 91]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14510	We gauged ookinete survival in dsCdc42 and dsFz2 knockdown L3–5 mosquitoes at 7 days post-infection (dpi) by counting the total numbers of GFP-expressing oocysts per midgut.	[[101, 104], [139, 142]]	[[80, 99]]	['dpi', 'GFP']	['days post-infection']	PMC1757202.nxml
14511	The important result of this experiment is that the knockdown of either Fz2 or Cdc42 did not ultimately lead to a significant increase in ookinete survival in refractory mosquitoes, compared with the control dslacZ-injected mosquitoes (Figure 6C and 6D)..	[[79, 84], [72, 75]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14512	In the L3–5 strain, where ookinete killing is virtually 100%, significantly fewer ookinetes were melanized in the Fz2 and Cdc42 knockdown mosquito midguts compared with the lacZ controls (melanization was reduced by 47% and 66%, respectively), indicating that although Fz2 and Cdc42 are important for the mosquito melanization response to parasites, killing can still occur even when melanization is suppressed..	[[122, 127], [277, 282], [114, 117], [269, 272]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Cdc42', 'Fz2', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14513	The individual knockdown phenotypes for Fz2 and Cdc42 were remarkably similar, suggesting that these molecules could be part of the same functional process.	[[48, 53], [40, 43]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14514	The double knockdown of Fz2/Cdc42 did not result in a significant increase in live oocysts, nor in a reduction in melanized ookinetes, compared with the single knockdowns.	[[28, 33]]	[]	['Cdc42']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14515	This could be interpreted as Fz2 and Cdc42 belonging to the same pathway, but it is also possible that the knockdowns were not sufficiently complete to allow us to detect a difference..	[[37, 42], [29, 32]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14516	Finally, we tested the effects of Fz2 and Cdc42 dsRNA knockdown on ookinete survival at 7 dpi in susceptible mosquitoes.	[[42, 47], [90, 93], [48, 53], [34, 37]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'dpi', 'dsRNA', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14517	Once again, ookinete survival was not significantly increased by knockdown of either Fz2 or Cdc42 compared with that of the control dslacZ-injected mosquitoes (Figure 7)..	[[92, 97], [85, 88]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14518	The essential result is that the processes of AZ formation and melanization are both partially disrupted by the knockdown of Cdc42 and Fz2.	[[46, 48], [125, 130]]	[]	['AZ', 'Cdc42']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14519	Our TEM microscope studies consistently demonstrated that the ookinetes are predominantly located in the extracellular space, where they are exposed to hemocyte-derived soluble immunity factors, rather than in intracellular locations.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14520	The dead ookinetes are surrounded by a zone of polymerized actin (the AZ), which is formed in adjacent host epithelial cells.	[[70, 72]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14521	We used a combination of confocal fluorescent microscopy and TEM with RNAi technology to demonstrate that formation of the AZ structure is triggered specifically by the presence of a P.	[[123, 125], [70, 74], [61, 64]]	[]	['AZ', 'RNAi', 'TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14523	We further demonstrated that formation of the AZ is dependent on TEP1, Fz2, and Cdc42.	[[46, 48], [71, 74], [65, 69]]	[]	['AZ', 'Fz2', 'TEP1']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14524	We were interested in the possibility that formation of the AZ could be an ookinete killing mechanism in refractory mosquitoes.	[[60, 62]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14525	However, RNAi knockdown experiments, where we partially abolished the AZ and melanization, clearly established that in contrast to TEP1, Fz2 and Cdc42 do not induce killing of parasites.

14526	Our results separate the mechanisms of parasite killing from subsequent reactions manifested by AZ formation and melanization..	[[96, 98]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14527	Classical midgut tissue repair/healing processes and AZ formation probably respond to a common basic stimulus (i.e., abnormal or damaged tissue), but in the case of AZ formation, it is a moribund parasite that provides this signal.	[[53, 55], [165, 167]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14528	The AZ reaction is characterized by actin polymerization and PPO activation, which is characterized by melanization in refractory mosquitoes..	[[4, 6], [61, 64]]	[]	['AZ', 'PPO']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14529	We have now identified a component of the AZ as polymerized actin and shown that the presence of the AZ and melanin is a predominant feature associated with dead ookinetes in refractory mosquitoes.	[[42, 44], [101, 103]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14530	berghei infection model, the AZ is morphologically distinct from other zones of polymerized actin that occur throughout the midgut, which assist the expulsion of dead epithelial cells and repair the remaining tissue [15–18].	[[29, 31]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14531	In contrast to this tissue repair process, the AZ is specifically provoked in the presence of a parasite, is only formed by the most basal part of the midgut cell, does not appear to facilitate cell expulsion, and is linked in an unknown way to melanization in refractory mosquitoes.	[[47, 49]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14532	All the midgut cells in contact with the ookinete contribute to the AZ, and all the cells appear to be healthy.	[[68, 70]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14533	Midgut cells are non-phagocytic; furthermore, our TEM observations of ookinete phagocytosis by cultured mosquito cells in vitro were very distinct structurally from anything seen by us in the midgut (S.	[[50, 53]]	[]	['TEM']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14534	In our study, dsRNA knockdown of Cdc42 and Fz2 decreased AZ formation in refractory mosquitoes.	[[57, 59], [33, 38], [14, 19], [43, 46]]	[]	['AZ', 'Cdc42', 'dsRNA', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14535	This strongly suggests a link between the AZ and melanization.	[[42, 44]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14536	The exact relationship between the AZ and melanization is complex and may also involve other factors, because a thinner AZ can form around a small percentage of non-melanized ookinetes in susceptible mosquitoes.	[[35, 37], [120, 122]]	[]	['AZ', 'AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14537	It would be interesting in this respect to determine whether, in susceptible G3 strain mosquitoes, the strength of AZ formation could be increased by the knockdowns of C-type lectin 4, SRPN2, or SRPN6, which lead to massive spontaneous melanization reactions [5,12,31].	[[115, 117]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14538	Furthermore, these knockdowns and double knockdowns of Fz2/SRPN6 and Cdc42/SRPN6 in L3–5 mosquitoes would provide more insight into the importance of melanization in AZ formation..	[[166, 168]]	[]	['AZ']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14539	The role of Cdc42 in AZ actin polymerization in L3–5 mosquitoes was not unexpected, because in other animals this cytoplasmic Rho family guanosine triphosphate–binding protein controls a wide array of cellular processes, including filopodium formation (via activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, profilin, the Arp2/3 complex, and finally, actin nucleation; reviewed by [28,32,33]).	[[21, 23], [12, 17]]	[]	['AZ', 'Cdc42']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14540	To our knowledge, however, this is the first study to implicate Fz2 in the control of actin polymerization in adult insects, and Fz2 and Cdc42 in the melanization response.	[[137, 142], [64, 67], [129, 132]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14541	The double knockdown of Fz2/Cdc42 did not significantly alter the single knockdown phenotype, implying that both molecules could be part of the same biochemical process, possibly with Fz2 acting as a transmembrane receptor upstream of the cytoplasmic Cdc42.	[[28, 33], [184, 187]]	[]	['Cdc42', 'Fz2']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml
14542	Clearly, the parasites did not utilize host actin polymerization or Cdc42 activities to achieve intracellular invasion, a mode of invasion recruited by certain bacteria (e.g., Shigella and Listeria [37–39]).	[[68, 73]]	[]	['Cdc42']	[]	PMC1757202.nxml

14606	The two viroid species chosen for this study were Chrysanthemum stunt pospiviroid (CSVd) [12] and Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle avsunviroid (CChMVd) [13].	[[142, 148], [83, 87]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14607	(i) In plants initially inoculated with equivalent amounts of each viroid and for which systemic infection was established for an extended period, the concentration of CChMVd per gram of fresh plant tissue was ∼20 times lower than for CSVd (Table 1), suggesting a lower net population growth rate for CChMVd.	[[168, 174], [235, 239]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14608	(ii) In contrast, the genetic variability of the CChMVd quasispecies was much larger than for the CSVd quasispecies by all indexes examined (Table 1).	[[49, 55], [98, 102]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14609	(iv) In silico, the neutral neighborhood (i.e., the fraction of all possible one-error mutants, including deletions, that do not change the minimum free energy secondary structure) for the CChMVd molecule is ∼2 times larger than for the CSVd molecule [17–19] (Table 1).	[[189, 195], [237, 241]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14610	Consistent with this, sequencing of multiple clones of both viroids from systemically infected plants revealed that CChMVd quasispecies were composed of molecules more diverse in folding stability (ratio of standard deviations for minimum free energies: 3.234) and shape [20] (ratio of standard deviations for differences in shape: 27.462) than CSVd quasispecies (Table 1).	[[116, 122], [345, 349]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14611	Therefore, CChMVd quasispecies grow slowly, are genetically heterogeneous, and exhibit a remarkable diversity of RNA secondary structures.	[[11, 17]]	[]	['CChMVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml

14615	After rooting, half of the plants were moved into a growth chamber (24 °C and a 16-h light period) and the other half were moved into a second chamber (same growth conditions) in which they were irradiated 10 min/d with an ultraviolet C light (UVC) germicidal lamp (Phillips G36T8; maximal output at 253.7 nm; dose 2 J/cm2).	[[244, 247]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14616	The negative impact of UVC radiation on the in vivo replication and accumulation of RNA viruses (e.g., [21–23]) and viroids [24] has been known for several decades.	[[23, 26]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14617	In addition, UVC radiation generates reactive oxygen species that may produce more than 35 different base modifications [28].	[[13, 16]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14618	The UVC daily dose used in this experiment was in the same order of magnitude as that required for inducing in vitro and in vivo intramolecular cross-linking in viroids from both families [29,30], while still minimizing its effect on the growth of the host plants..	[[4, 7]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14619	Figure 1 shows that a UVC-induced increase in mutation rate affects the outcome of the competition between CChMVd and CSVd (t-test, p = 0.002).	[[107, 113], [118, 122], [22, 25]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14620	Under unmanipulated (i.e., low mutation rate) conditions, the median ratio CChMVd:CSVd significantly decreased as CSVd outcompeted CChMVd (t-test, p = 0.011).	[[75, 81], [131, 137], [82, 86], [114, 118]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CChMVd', 'CSVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14621	The negative slope of the log regression on the median values, −0.086 ± 0.019, represents a measure of the selective disadvantage of CChMVd relative to CSVd.	[[133, 139]]	[]	['CChMVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14622	In contrast, when the mutation rate was artificially increased by UVC, the competition was completely different, and the faster replicator CSVd was no longer able to outcompete the more robust replicator CChMVd, as predicted by the survival-of-the-flattest effect.	[[204, 210], [139, 143], [66, 69]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14623	The slope of the log regression (0.017 ± 0.033) was slightly, although non-significantly (t-test, p = 0.622), positive, suggesting that the competitive advantage of CSVd vanished as a consequence of the 2-fold larger mutational neutral neighborhood surrounding CChMVd's optimum genotype..	[[165, 169]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14624	It was necessary to exclude the possibility that the above observations were driven primarily by UVC-induced differences in plant responses to viroid infection (e.g., UVC light induction of SOS-like functions that disproportionately affected CSVd replication) rather than, as we hypothesized, determined by the competition dynamics between both viroids.	[[242, 246], [97, 100], [167, 170]]	[]	['CSVd', 'UVC', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14625	The UVC treatment negatively impacted the accumulation of both viroids.	[[4, 7]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14626	However, this negative effect of UVC light on viroid accumulation during single infections was the same for both viroids (test of the interaction term: F1,35 = 2.245, p = 0.143).	[[33, 36]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14627	Nevertheless, this is a negative result, and the objection can be raised that our experiment lacked sufficient power to reject the null hypothesis of no differential effect of UVC radiation on each viroid's accumulation.	[[176, 179]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14628	Hence, in the worst case, the probability of accepting the null hypothesis of equal effects of UVC radiation on the accumulation of CSVd and CChMVd as actually being false is only p = 0.050.	[[141, 147], [132, 136], [95, 98]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14629	Therefore, we conclude that the outcome of the competition experiments run under mutagenic conditions is most likely due to the survival-of-the-flattest effect rather than to viroid-specific interactions with plant factors influenced by UVC irradiation.	[[237, 240]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14630	As such, it may be possible that UVC induced changes in plant physiology that had a minor effect on CSVd replication and were undetectable with the power of our experiments; however, these changes became important only during competition against CChMVd.	[[100, 104], [33, 36]]	[]	['CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14631	To better understand the effect of the mutagenic and control treatments on the genetic composition of CChMVd and CSVd quasispecies, we randomly picked three plants from each treatment after 6 wk and cloned and sequenced 20 molecules from each viroid per plant.	[[102, 108], [113, 117]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14632	First, we confirmed the mutagenic effect of UVC radiation.	[[44, 47]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14633	If UVC radiation increases genetic variability, then it is expected that the number of new haplotypes (i.e., those that were not detected in the coinfected plants prior to the mutagenic treatment) in the irradiated plants would be larger than in the non-irradiated plants.	[[3, 6]]	[]	['UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14634	When this calculation was done for CSVd, the average frequency of new haplotypes across non-irradiated plants (Dataset S5) was 66.87% (i.e., approximately 1/3 of the haplotypes were already detected in the ancestral population), but increased to 92.32% in irradiated plants (Dataset S6) (i.e., only 7.68% of identified haplotypes were detected in the ancestral population).	[[35, 39]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14635	The picture for CChMVd is slightly different.	[[16, 22]]	[]	['CChMVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14636	None of the haplotypes present in the ancestral population was detected in the evolved ones; thus, both UVC-treated (Dataset S3) and non-treated (Dataset S2) CChMVd populations were constituted by newly created haplotypes.	[[158, 164], [104, 107]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14637	This is not surprising given the already high level of diversity in CChMVd prior to the competition experiment..	[[68, 74]]	[]	['CChMVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14638	In other words, a larger genetic variability is expected for CChMVd under UVC than under control conditions.	[[61, 67], [74, 77]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14639	CChMVd quasispecies replicating under UVC contained, on average, 0.8% more haplotypes and 30.3% more nucleotide differences than CChMVd quasispecies replicating under non-mutagenic conditions.	[[129, 135], [38, 41]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14640	Hence, a reduction in the amount of viable (and therefore detectable) genetic variation within CSVd quasispecies is expected under UVC conditions.	[[95, 99], [131, 134]]	[]	['CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14641	Indeed, this is the pattern observed for CSVd (Figure 2).	[[41, 45]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14642	On average, CSVd quasispecies that evolved at a high mutation rate contained 24.9% fewer haplotypes than control populations (test of the UVC effect; p = 0.009) and with 30.3% fewer nucleotide differences (p < 0.001)..	[[12, 16], [138, 141]]	[]	['CSVd', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14643	The previously mentioned non-viability for highly mutated CSVd genomes was incorporated by the cutoff condition f(k) = 0 if k > kc.	[[58, 62]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14644	The algorithm systematically searched the parameter space defined by {sCSVd, sCChMVd, μ, μUVC, kc}, where μ and μUVC are the mutation rates under control and UVC conditions, respectively.	[[90, 93], [113, 116], [158, 161]]	[]	['UVC', 'UVC', 'UVC']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14645	If the survival-of-the-flattest effect is at work, the average fitness of the digital-CSVd population should be smaller than the average fitness of the digital-CChMVd population after some critical mutation rate, μcrit, is exceeded.	[[160, 166], [86, 90]]	[]	['CChMVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14646	Results perfectly match those observed in planta for a 4-fold increase in mutation rate and a mutational load cutoff for CSVd of three mutations (regression of observed to simulated data: R2 = 0.995, p = 0.003)..	[[121, 125]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14647	In silico results are consistent with the in planta observations: digital-CChMVd populations were 38.5% more diverse after the mutation rate increase.	[[74, 80]]	[]	['CChMVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14648	The situation for digital-CSVd populations replicating at a high mutation rate is a bit more complex and depends on whether or not lethal genotypes are taken into consideration when computing the average DH between digital genomes.	[[26, 30]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14649	When lethal genotypes were incorporated into the computation, digital-CSVd population diversity also increased to 45.4%.	[[70, 74]]	[]	['CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14650	However, if lethals were not considered for calculating the average DH, digital-CSVd populations were 51.4% less variable than non-mutagenized digital-CSVd populations, which is in agreement with the in planta observations.	[[80, 84], [151, 155]]	[]	['CSVd', 'CSVd']	[]	PMC1757203.nxml
14651	Thus, we conclude that the apparent reduction in genetic diversity experimentally observed for CSVd populations competing at a high mutation rate is entirely explained by the existence of a large fraction of lethal genotypes that bring about the reversal of fortune in the survival-of-the-flattest effect.

14975	This effect was revealed for CD4 cell depletion or for AIDS progression, reflecting early or late stage of disease progression, in AA and EA, respectively.	[[131, 133], [138, 140]]	[]	['AA', 'EA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14976	We further found that both SNPs had differential binding efficiency to nuclear proteins in the gel shift experiment.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14977	These findings suggest that the functional promoter SNP3/SNP4 influences HIV-1 disease progression..	[[73, 78]]	[]	['HIV-1']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14978	The nucleotide sequence of PPIA is 98% identical between human and chimpanzee.	[[27, 31]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14979	No variation in the coding sequence of human PPIA was found in this study or in the dbSNP database.	[[45, 49]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14980	This suggests that differential genetic impact of PPIA SNPs and haplotypes on infection and progression are likely due to regulatory region variation affecting protein levels.	[[50, 54], [55, 58]]	[]	['PPIA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14981	The regulation and promoter function of human PPIA is still undefined.	[[46, 50]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14982	Sequence analysis revealed that PPIA promoter contains a TATA box and two SP1 binding sites and is highly GC-rich (~70%) with overrepresented CpG dinucleotides [24].	[[32, 36]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14983	In this study, we identified two SNPs, each located in two additional SP1 binding elements.	[[33, 36]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14984	These two SNP changes, SNP3G and SNP4G, always occurring together through LD, had opposite effects on the nuclear protein binding.	[[74, 76], [10, 13]]	[]	['LD', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14985	Assuming the predicted stronger SP1 binding effect of SNP4 is dominant over the weaker SP1 binding of SNP3, a higher PPIA gene expression would be predicted.	[[117, 121]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14986	Based on our analyses of eight SNPs covering the entire gene region of PPIA and their haplotypes, we found that the PPIA disease-modifying effects were most likely afforded by promoter SNP3 or SNP4 and the associations with the downstream SNPs 7–11 were largely due to tracking of these two SNPs through LD.

14988	In the ex vivo experiment, both SNPs showed nonsignificant tendencies toward greater HIV-1 replication, with the effects of SNP5 being more pronounced.	[[85, 90], [32, 35]]	[]	['HIV-1', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14989	In the population study, both SNPs were associated with faster CD4+ T-cell depletion in a model also containing two other candidate genes (model 2); with the SNP5 of PPIA effect again being more pronounced.	[[166, 170], [30, 33]]	[]	['PPIA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14990	In contrast, no evidence supporting a role of SNP5 in AIDS progression was found, although the SNP5 G allele was carried significantly less often in HREU than in SC but was similarly distributed in SC and SN.	[[149, 153], [162, 164], [198, 200]]	[]	['HREU', 'SC', 'SC']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14991	Thus, the role of CypA polymorphism in HIV-1 infection remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation.	[[18, 22], [39, 44]]	[]	['CypA', 'HIV-1']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14992	Taken together, the association and functional results from these two studies point to a role of PPIA genetic variation in HIV-1/AIDS.	[[97, 101]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14993	In future studies, it may be informative to determine the mechanism of association between PPIA variants and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or disease progression in view of the interaction between CypA and the capsid domain of the Gag polyprotein..	[[206, 210], [132, 137], [91, 95]]	[]	['CypA', 'HIV-1', 'PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14994	This approach has led to identification of various genetic factors that affect HIV-1/AIDS, and has provided unique insights into the host HIV-1 interaction [26,27].	[[138, 143]]	[]	['HIV-1']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14995	In this study, the plausible genetic-modifying role of PPIA is supported by replication in two independent ethnic groups and the demonstration that SNPs 3 and 4 are each associated with altered binding affinities to transcription factors.	[[55, 59], [148, 151]]	[]	['PPIA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14996	Our comprehensive analysis of nearly all variant alleles and their haplotypes in the PPIA gene is, in essence, equivalent to a gene-based approach [28].	[[85, 89]]	[]	['PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14997	A major problem facing genetic association studies is the difficulty in replication, particularly for single SNP associations.	[[109, 112]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14998	One reason for failure to replicate previous studies is due to potential differences in allele frequencies and LD structure across populations.	[[111, 113]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
14999	The entire gene with prior SNP association is considered the functional unit and is examined for association with effectively all genetic variation in the gene.	[[27, 30]]	[]	['SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
15000	Nonreplication due to population differences may be minimized as local allele frequencies and LD structure from study populations are considered with this approach [28].	[[94, 96]]	[]	['LD']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
15001	Thus, our comprehensive survey of PPIA genetic variation and LD structure may facilitate future comparisons of replication studies using a gene-based approach..	[[61, 63], [34, 38]]	[]	['LD', 'PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
15002	In summary, through genetic epidemiological and functional approaches, we have identified two promoter SNPs in PPIA as potential genetic modifiers of HIV-1 disease progression.	[[150, 155], [111, 115], [103, 106]]	[]	['HIV-1', 'PPIA', 'SNP']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
15003	Our findings corroborate the notion that genetic variation of PPIA influences AIDS pathogenesis and provide in vivo evidence that CypA is a critical host protein in interaction with HIV-1.	[[130, 134], [62, 66]]	[]	['CypA', 'PPIA']	[]	PMC1894826.nxml
